# .gitignore DIME template
# https://github.com/worldbank/DIMEwiki/tree/master/Topics/GitHub
#
# We recommend that you create a .gitignore file using GitHub's tools and
# replace the content of that file with the content of this file. Otherwise
# you have to rename this file .gitignore. But if you rename the fine in a
# regular folder window PCs and Macs are likely to keep the file extension
# so that the file ends up being names .gitignore.txt. Code editors like, Atom,
# can edit the file extension, but if you are not familiar with how to do that,
# we recommend that you generate an ignore file using GitHub and simply replace
# the content of that file.
#
# Note that if you are using GitKraken you need to use version 5.x or more
# recent for this template to work properly

# For performance reasons, if a folder is already ignored, then
# GitHub does not check the content for that folder for matches
# with additional rules. The line below includes folder in the
# top folder (but not their content), so that anything matching
# the rules below will still not be ignored.

# password or passwords are also ignored. NOTE that your project might be
# using different names and then you must edit the lines below accordingly.
