# .gitignore DIME template
# https://github.com/worldbank/DIMEwiki/tree/master/Topics/GitHub
#
# We recommend that you create a .gitignore file using GitHub's tools and
# replace the content of that file with the content of this file. Otherwise
# you have to rename this file .gitignore. But if you rename the fine in a
# regular folder window PCs and Macs are likely to keep the file extension
# so that the file ends up being names .gitignore.txt. Code editors like, Atom,
# can edit the file extension, but if you are not familiar with how to do that,
# we recommend that you generate an ignore file using GitHub and simply replace
# the content of that file.
#
# Note that if you are using GitKraken you need to use version 5.x or more
# recent for this template to work properly

# Start by ignoring everything, and below we are explicitly saying
# what to not ignore
*

#######################
# List of files with GitHub functionality anywhere in the repo
# that we do not want to ignore

# These files include GitHub settings
!.gitignore
!.gitattributes

# Keep markdown files used for documentation on GitHub
!README.md
!CONTRIBUTING.md

# Keep documentation files for GitHub Sites
!/**/*.yml

#######################
# For performance reasons, if a folder is already ignored, then
# GitHub does not check the content for that folder for matches
# with additional rules. The line below includes folder in the
# top folder (but not their content), so that anything matching
# the rules below will still not be ignored.
!*/

#######################
# The following file types are code that should always be
# included no matter where in the repository folder they are
# located unless you explicitly ignore that folder

# Stata
!/**/*.do
!/**/*.ado

# More
!/**/*.sh
!/**/*.bib

# R
!/**/*.R

# LaTeX
!/**/*.tex
!/**/*.cls
!/**/*.def

# Python
!/**/*.py

# Matlab
!/**/*.m

# Markdown
!/**/*.md

#######################
# Include some additional file formats in any output folder. You might have
# to change the name of the Output folder to whatever it is called in your
# project, but we strongly recommend that you only include these files in
# a subset of the folders where you are certain no private data is ever stored.
!/**/Output/**/*.txt
!/**/Output/**/*.csv
!/**/Output/**/*.xml
!/**/Output/**/*.eps
!/**/Output/**/*.svg

#######################
# Include all the files with passwords or tokens here. All files named
# password or passwords are with this template ignored no matter which
# format you are using. Additionally, all content in any folder called
password or passwords are also ignored. NOTE that your project might be
using different names and then you must edit the lines below accordingly.
