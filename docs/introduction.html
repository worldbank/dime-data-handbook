<h1>Introduction<a href="introduction.html#introduction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p><em>Development Research in Practice: The DIME Analytics Data Handbook</em> is intended
to teach all users of development data how to handle data effectively,
efficiently, and ethically. An empirical revolution has changed the face of
development research over the last decade. Increasingly, researchers are working
not just with complex data, but with <em>original</em> data—data sets collected by the
research team itself or acquired through a unique agreement with a project
partner. Research teams must carefully document how original data are created,
handled, and analyzed. These tasks now contribute as much weight to the quality
of the evidence as the research design and the statistical approaches do. At the
same time, empirical research projects are expanding in scope and scale: more
people are working on the same data over longer time frames. For that reason,
the central premise of this book is that data work is a “social process,” which
means that the many people on a team need to have the same ideas about what is
to be done, when, where, and by whom so that they can collaborate effectively on
a large, long-term research project.</p>
<p>Despite the growing importance of managing data work, little practical guidance
is available for practitioners. There are few guides to the conventions,
standards, and best practices that are fast becoming a necessity for empirical
research. <em>Development Research in Practice</em> aims to fill that gap. It covers
the full data workflow for a complex research project using original data,
sharing the lessons, tools, and processes developed within the World Bank’s
Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) department, and compiling them into a
single narrative of best practices for data work. This book is not sector
specific; it does not teach econometrics or how to design an impact evaluation.
Many excellent resources address those topics. Instead, it teaches how to think
about all aspects of research from a data perspective, how to structure research
projects to ensure high-quality data, and how to institute transparent and
reproducible workflows. Adopting these workflows may have significant up-front
learning costs, but these investments pay off quickly, saving time and improving
the quality of research going forward.</p>

<h2>How to read this book<a href="introduction.html#how-to-read-this-book" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>This book aims to be a highly practical resource so that readers can immediately
begin to collaborate more effectively on large, long-term research projects
using the methods and tools discussed. This introduction outlines the basic
philosophies that motivate this book and the approach taken to research data.
The central message is that research data work is primarily about communicating
effectively within a team and that effective collaboration is enabled by
standardization and simplification of data tasks. This book provides a narrative
outline of the data workflow at each stage of an empirical research project,
from design to publication, as visualized in figure I.1. Chapters 1 and 2
contextualize the workflow and set the stage for the hands-on data tasks
described in detail in chapters 3 to 7.</p>

</div>
<p>Chapter 1 outlines the principles and practices that help consumers of research
to be confident in the conclusions reached and describes the three pillars of a
high-quality empirical research project: credibility, transparency, and
reproducibility. It presents three popular methods of committing to the use of
particular research questions or methods, discusses how to apply principles of
transparency to all research processes, and provides guidance on how to make
research fully reproducible.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 teaches readers how to structure data work for collaborative research
while ensuring the privacy and security of research participants. It discusses
the importance of planning data work and associated tools in advance, long
before any data are acquired. It also describes ethical concerns common to
development data, common pitfalls in legal and practical management of data, and
how to respect the rights of research participants at all stages of data work.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 turns to the measurement framework, describing how to translate
research design into a data work plan. It details DIME’s data map template, a
set of tools to communicate the project’s data requirements both across the team
and across time. It also discusses how to implement random sampling and random
assignment in a reproducible and credible manner.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 covers data acquisition. It starts with the legal and institutional
frameworks for data ownership and licensing, examining the rights and
responsibilities of using data collected by the research team or by others. It
provides a deep dive on collecting high-quality primary electronic survey data,
including developing and deploying survey instruments. Finally, it discusses how
to handle data securely during transfer, sharing, and storage, because secure
data handling is essential to protecting respondent privacy.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 describes data-processing tasks. It details how to construct “tidy”
data at the appropriate units of analysis, how to ensure uniquely identified
data sets, and how to incorporate data quality checks routinely into the
workflow. It also provides guidance on the process of de-identifying and
cleaning personally identifying data, focusing on how to understand and
structure data in preparation for constructing indicators and performing
analytical work.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 discusses data analysis tasks. It begins with data construction, which
is the creation of new variables from the original data. It introduces core
principles for writing analytical code and creating, exporting, and storing
research outputs such as figures and tables reproducibly, using dynamic
documents.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 outlines the publication of research outputs, including manuscripts,
code, and data. It discusses how to collaborate effectively on technical writing
using dynamic documents. It also covers how and why to publish data sets in an
accessible, citable, and safe fashion. Finally, it provides guidelines for
preparing functional and informative reproducibility packages that contain all
of the code, data, and metadata needed for others to evaluate and reproduce the
work.</p>
<p>Each chapter starts with a box summarizing the most important points, takeaways
for different types of readers, and a list of key tools and resources for
implementing the recommended practices. Each chapter provides an understanding
of which tasks will be performed at every stage of the workflow and how to
implement them according to best practices. Each also provides an understanding
of how the various stages of the workflow tie together and what inputs and
outputs are required and produced from each. The references and links contained
in each chapter lead to detailed descriptions of individual ideas, tools, and
processes that will be useful when implementing the tasks. Box I.1 describes the
Demand for Safe Spaces project, which is the basis for the examples given
throughout this handbook.</p>
<div id="box-i.1-the-demand-for-safe-spaces-case-study" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor ex">
<h4>BOX I.1 THE DEMAND FOR SAFE SPACES CASE STUDY<a href="introduction.html#box-i.1-the-demand-for-safe-spaces-case-study" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>A completed project, Demand for Safe Spaces: Avoiding Harassment and Stigma, is
used to illustrate the empirical research tasks described throughout this
handbook. Each chapter contains boxes with examples of how the practices and
workflows described in it were applied in this real-life example. All of the
examples of code and diagrams referenced in the case study can be accessed
directly through this book’s GitHub repository. Minor adaptations were made to
the original study materials for function and clarity. All of the original
materials are included in the project’s reproducibility package. The Demand for
Safe Spaces study is summarized in its abstract as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the costs to women of harassment on public transit? This study
randomizes the price of a women-reserved “safe space” in Rio de Janeiro and
crowdsources information on 22,000 rides. Women in the public space
experience harassment once a week. A fifth of riders are willing to forgo 20
percent of the fare to ride in the “safe space.” Randomly assigning riders
to the “safe space” reduces physical harassment by 50 percent, implying a
cost of $1.45 per incident. Implicit association tests show that women face
a stigma for riding in the public space that may outweigh the benefits of
the safe space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Demand for Safe Spaces study used novel original data from three sources. It
collected information on 22,000 metro rides from a crowdsourcing app (referred
to as crowdsourced ride data in the case study examples), a survey of randomly
sampled commuters on the platform (referred to as the platform survey), and data
from an implicit association test. The research team first elicited revealed
preferences for the women-reserved cars and then randomly assigned riders across
the reserved and nonreserved cars to measure differences in the incidence of
harassment. Researchers used a customized app to assign data collection tasks
and to vary assigned ride spaces (women-reserved cars vs. public cars) and the
associated payout across rides. In addition, the team administered social norm
surveys and implicit association tests on a random sample of men and women
commuters to document a potential side effect of reserved spaces: stigma against
women who choose to ride in the public space.</p>
<p>This handbook focuses on the protocols, methods, and data used in the Demand for
Safe Spaces study rather than on the results. A working paper by <span class="citation">Kondylis et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-kondylis2020demand">2020</a>)</span>
provides more information about the findings from this study and how it
was conducted.</p>

<div id="standardizing-data-work" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Standardizing data work<a href="introduction.html#standardizing-data-work" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In the past, data work was often treated as a “black box” in research. A
published manuscript might exhaustively detail research designs, estimation
strategies, and theoretical frameworks, but typically reserved very little space
for detailed descriptions of how data were collected and handled. It is almost
impossible to assess the quality of the data in such a paper and whether the
results could be reproduced. This situation is changing, in part because more
publishers and funders are requiring researchers to release their code and data
(<span class="citation">Swanson et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-swanson2020research">2020</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Handling data and producing documentation are key skills for researchers and
research staff. Standard data processes and documentation practices are
important throughout the research process to convey and implement the intended
research design accurately (<span class="citation">Vilhuber (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-vilhuber_lars_2020_3911311">2020</a>)</span>) and to minimize
security risks: better protocols and processes lower the probability of data
leakages, security breaches, and loss of personal information. When data work
has been done in an ad hoc manner, it is very difficult for others to understand
what has been done—readers simply have to trust that the researchers have
performed these tasks correctly. Most important, if any part of the data
pipeline breaks down, research results become unreliable
(<span class="citation">McCullough, McGeary, and Harrison (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-mccullough2008economics">2008</a>)</span>) and cannot be accepted at face value according to the
intended research design (Goldstein 2016). Because “laboratory” settings almost
never exist in this type of research, such a failure has a very high cost (for
an example, see <span class="citation">Baldwin and Mvukiyehe (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-baldwin2015elections">2015</a>)</span>): failure wastes the investments made in
knowledge generation and wastes the research opportunity itself
(<span class="citation">Camerer et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-camerer2016evaluating">2016</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Accurate and reproducible data management and analysis are essential to the
success and credibility of modern research. Data-handling processes need to be
standardized and documented for the data work to be evaluated and understood
alongside any final research outputs. <em>Process standardization</em> is an important
component of this effort. Process standardization is an agreement within a
research team about how all tasks of a specific type will be approached. It
means that there is little ambiguity about how something ought to be done and
therefore that the tools to do it can be set in advance. Standard processes help
other people to understand the work and make the work easier to document.
Process standardization and documentation allow readers of code to (1)
understand quickly what a particular process or output is supposed to be doing,
(2) evaluate whether or not it does that task correctly, and (3) modify it
either to test alternative hypotheses or to adapt it in their own work. This
book discusses specific standards recommended by DIME Analytics, but the goal is
to convince readers to discuss the adoption of a standard within research teams
rather than necessarily to use the particular standards recommended here.</p>
</div>
<div id="standardizing-coding-practices" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Standardizing coding practices<a href="introduction.html#standardizing-coding-practices" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Modern quantitative research relies heavily on statistical software tools,
written with various coding languages, to standardize analytical work. Outputs
like regression tables and data visualizations are created using code in
statistical software for two primary reasons. Using a standard command or
package ensures that the work is done right and that the procedure can be
confirmed or checked using the same data at a later date or implemented again
using different data. Keeping a clear, human-readable record of these code and
data structures is critical. Although it is often possible to perform nearly all
of the relevant tasks through an interactive user interface or even through
software such as Excel, this practice is strongly discouraged. In the context of
statistical analysis, the practice of writing all work using standard code is
widely accepted. To support this practice, DIME now maintains portfolio-wide
standards about how analytical code should be maintained and made accessible
before, during, and after release or publication.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, DIME has extended the same principles to preparing data
for analysis, which often constitutes just as much (or more) of the manipulation
done to data over the life cycle of a research project. This book encourages
research teams to think about the tools and processes they use for designing,
collecting, and handling data just as they do for conducting analysis. To this
end, DIME Analytics has contributed tools and standard practices for
implementing these tasks using statistical software.</p>
<p>Although most researchers do nearly all data work using code, many come from
economics and statistics backgrounds rather than computer science backgrounds,
and they often understand code to be a means to an end rather than an output
itself. This attitude needs to change: in particular, development practitioners
must think about their code and programming workflows just as methodically as
they think about their research workflows; they need to think of code and data
as research outputs, similar to manuscripts and briefs.</p>
<p>This approach arises because code is the “recipe” for the analysis. The code
tells others exactly what was done, explains how they can do it again in the
future, and provides a road map and knowledge base for further original work
(<span class="citation">Hamermesh (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-hamermesh2007replication">2007</a>)</span>). Performing tasks through written code creates a
record of every task performed (<span class="citation">Ozier (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-ozier2019replication">2019</a>)</span>). It also prevents direct
interaction with the data files that could lead to nonreproducible processes
(<span class="citation">Chang and Li (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-chang2015economics">2015</a>)</span>). DIME Analytics has invested a lot of time in developing
code as a learning tool: the examples written and the commands provided in this
book are designed to provide a framework for common practice, so that everyone
working on these tasks in DIME is able to read, review, and provide feedback on
the work of others, starting from the same basic ideas about how various tasks
are done.</p>
<p>Most specific code tools have a learning and adaptation process, meaning that
researchers will become most comfortable with each tool only by using it in the
real world. To support the process of learning to create and use reproducible
tools and workflows, this handbook references free and open-source tools
wherever possible and points to more detailed instructions when relevant. Stata,
a proprietary software, is the notable exception because of its persistent
popularity in development economics and econometrics (StataCorp 2021). Appendix
A presents two guides: the DIME Analytics Coding Guide , which provides
instructions on how to write good code and how to use the examples of code in
this book, and the DIME Analytics Stata Style Guide. DIME project teams are
strongly encouraged to adopt and follow coding style guides explicitly in their
work. Style guides harmonize code practices within and across teams, making it
easier to understand and reuse code, which ultimately helps teams to build on
each other’s best practices. Some of the programming languages used at DIME
already have well-established and commonly used style guides, such as the
<em>Tidyverse Style Guide</em> for R and PEP-8 for Python (see van Rossum, Warsaw, and
Coghlan 2013; Wickham, n.d.). Relatively few resources of this type are
available for Stata, which is why DIME Analytics has created and included one
here. For the complete DIME Analytics Coding Standards, see the GitHub
repository at <a href="https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards" class="uri">https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards</a>.</p>

<h2>The team behind this book<a href="introduction.html#the-team-behind-this-book" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>DIME generates high-quality, operationally relevant data and research to
transform development policy and support the World Bank’s mission of reducing
extreme poverty and securing shared prosperity (<span class="citation">Legovini, Di Maro, and Piza (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-legovini2015impact">2015</a>)</span>). DIME
develops customized data and evidence ecosystems to produce actionable
information and recommend specific policy pathways to maximize impact. DIME
conducts research in 60 countries with 200 agencies, leveraging a US$180 million
research budget to shape the design and implementation of US$18 billion in
development finance. DIME also provides advisory services to 30 multilateral and
bilateral development agencies (<span class="citation">Legovini et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-legovini2019">2019</a>)</span>). DIME research is organized into
four primary topics: economic transformation and growth; gender, economic
opportunity, and fragility; governance and institution building; and
infrastructure and climate change. Over the years, DIME has employed dozens of
research economists and hundreds of full-time research assistants, field
coordinators, and other staff. The team has conducted more than 325 impact
evaluations. <em>Development Research in Practice</em> takes advantage of the
concentration and scale of this research to synthesize many resources for data
collection and research and make DIME tools available to the larger community of
development researchers. (For more information, see
<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime" class="uri">https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime</a>.)</p>
<p>As part of its broader mission, DIME invests in public goods to improve the
quality and reproducibility of development research around the world. DIME
Analytics, the team responsible for writing and maintaining this book, is a
centralized unit that develops and ensures the adoption of high-quality research
practices across the DIME portfolio. It works through an intensive,
collaborative innovation cycle: DIME Analytics trains and supports research
assistants and field coordinators, provides standard tools and workflows to all
teams, delivers hands-on support when new tasks or challenges arise, and then
develops and integrates lessons from those engagements to bring to the full
team. Resources developed and tested in DIME are converted into public goods for
the global research community through open-access trainings and open-source
tools. Appendix B, the DIME Analytics resource directory, provides an
introduction to public materials.</p>
<p>DIME Analytics has devoted many hours to learning from data work across DIME’s
portfolio, identifying inefficiencies and barriers to success, developing tools
and trainings, and standardizing best-practice workflows adopted in DIME
projects. It has invested significant energy in the language and materials used
to teach these workflows to new team members and, in many cases, in software
tools that support these workflows explicitly. DIME team members often work on
diverse portfolios of projects with a wide range of teammates and have found
that standardizing core processes across all projects results in higher-quality
work, with fewer opportunities to make mistakes. In that way, the DIME Analytics
team has institutionalized, developed, and refined tools and practices over time
and given the department a common base of knowledge and practice. In 2018, for
example, DIME adopted universal reproducibility checks for publications; the
lessons from this practice helped to move the DIME team from having 50 percent
of the papers assessed for reproducibility in 2018 require significant revision

<p>Although adopting the workflows and mind-sets described in this book requires an
up-front cost, it will save research teams a lot of time and hassle very
quickly. In part this is because readers will learn how to implement essential
practices directly, in part because they will find new tools for more advanced
practices, and, most important, because they will acquire the mind-set of doing
research with a focus on high-quality data. Some readers may find the number of
new tools and practices recommended in this book to be daunting (see figure
I.1). The experience at DIME has shown that full-scale adoption is possible; in
the last few years, the full DIME portfolio has transitioned to transparent and
reproducible workflows, with a fair share of hiccups along the way. The authors
of this book were involved in supporting that at-scale transition and hope that,
by sharing the resources and lessons learned, the learning curve for readers
will be less steep. The summary boxes at the beginning of each chapter provide a
list of the key tools and resources to help readers to prioritize. The handbook
also offers “second-best” practices in many cases, suggesting easy-to-implement
ways to increase transparency and reproducibility in cases when full-scale
adoption of the recommended workflow is not immediately feasible. In fact, teams
are encouraged to adopt one new practice at a time rather than to rebuild their
whole workflow from scratch right away. It is hoped that, by the end of the
book, all readers will have learned how to handle data more efficiently,
effectively, and ethically at all stages of the research process.</p>
