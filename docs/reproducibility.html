<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Conducting reproducible, transparent, and credible research<a href="reproducibility.html#reproducibility" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Policy decisions are made every day using the results of development research,
and these decisions have wide-reaching effects on the lives of millions. As the
emphasis on evidence-informed policy grows, so too does the scrutiny placed on
research methods and results. Three major components make up this scrutiny:
credibility, transparency, and reproducibility. These three components
contribute to one simple idea: research should be high quality and well
documented. Research consumers, including policy makers who use the evidence to
make decisions, should be able to examine and recreate it easily. In this
framework, it is useful to think of research as a public service that requires
researchers as a group to be accountable for their methods. Accountability means
acting collectively to protect the credibility of development research by
following modern practices for research planning and documentation.</p>
<p>Across the social sciences, the open science movement has been fueled by
concerns regarding the proliferation of low-quality research practices; data and
code that are inaccessible to the public; analytical errors in major research
papers; and, in some cases, even outright fraud. Although the development
research community has not yet experienced major scandals, improvements clearly
are needed in how code and data are handled as part of research. Moreover,
having common standards and practices for creating and sharing materials, code,
and data with others will improve the value of the work that researchers do.</p>
<p>This chapter outlines principles and practices that help research consumers to
have confidence in the conclusions reached. Each of the three
components—credibility, transparency, and reproducibility—is discussed in
turn. The first section covers research credibility. It presents three popular
methods of committing to the use of particular research questions or methods and
avoiding potential criticisms of cherry-picking results: study registration,
preanalysis plans, and registered reports. The second section discusses how to
apply principles of transparency to all research processes, which allows
research teams to be more efficient and research consumers to understand
thoroughly and evaluate the quality of research. The final section provides
guidance on how to make research fully reproducible and explains why replication
materials are an important research contribution in their own right. Box 1.1
summarizes the main points, lists the responsibilities of different members of
the research team, and supplies a list of key tools and resources for
implementing the recommended practices.</p>

<h4>BOX 1.1 SUMMARY: CONDUCTING REPRODUCIBLE, TRANSPARENT, AND CREDIBLE RESEARCH<a href="reproducibility.html#box-1.1-summary-conducting-reproducible-transparent-and-credible-research" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Credibility, transparency, and reproducibility are three pillars of a
high-quality empirical research project. The steps and outputs discussed in this
chapter should be prepared at the beginning of a project and revisited through
the publication process.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Credibility.</em> To enhance credibility, researchers need to make as many
research decisions as possible before beginning data work. These decisions
can be precommitted publicly through the following mechanisms:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Register research studies to provide a record of every project, so that all
evidence about a topic can be maintained; preregister studies to protect
design choices from later criticism.</li>
<li>Write preanalysis plans both to strengthen the conclusions drawn from those
analyses and to increase efficiency by creating a road map for project data
work.</li>
<li>Publish a registered report to combine the benefits of the first two steps
with a formal peer review process and conditional acceptance of the results
of the specified research.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Transparency.</em> All data acquisition and analysis decisions made during the
project life cycle should be documented, including details on what
information will be released publicly and a plan for how it will be
published:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Develop and publish comprehensive project documentation, especially
instruments for data collection or acquisition that may be needed to prove
ownership rights and facilitate the reuse of data.</li>
<li>Retain the original data in an unaltered form and archive data
appropriately, in preparation for de-identification and publication at the
appropriate times.</li>
<li>Write all data-processing and analysis code with public release in mind.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Reproducibility.</em> Analytical work needs to be prepared so that it can be
verified and reproduced by others. To do so, the research team should do the
following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Understand what archives and repositories are appropriate for various
materials.</li>
<li>Prepare for legal documentation and licensing of data, code, and research
products.</li>
<li>Initiate reproducible workflows that will transfer easily within and outside
of the research team, and provide the necessary documentation for others to
understand and use all materials.</li>

<h2>Developing a credible research project<a href="reproducibility.html#developing-a-credible-research-project" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The evidentiary value of research is traditionally a function of
<em>research design</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> choices, such as
<em>sampling</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, <em>randomization</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and robustness to alternative
specifications and definitions (<span class="citation">Angrist and Pischke (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-angrist2010credibility" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Ioannidis (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-ioannidis2005most" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). A
frequent target for critics of research is the fact that researchers often have
a lot of leeway in choosing projects or in selecting results or outcomes after
they have implemented projects or collected data in the field
(<span class="citation">Ioannidis, Stanley, and Doucouliagos (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-ioannidis2017power" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). Such leeway increases the likelihood of finding “false
positive” results that are not true outside of carefully selected data
(<span class="citation">Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-simmons2011false" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>). Credible methods of research design are key to maintaining
credibility in these choices and avoiding serious errors. They are especially
relevant for research that relies on original data sources, from innovative big
data sources to unique surveys. Development researchers should take these
concerns seriously. Such flexibility can be a significant issue for the quality
of evidence overall, particularly if researchers believe that certain types of
results are substantially better for their careers or their publication chances.</p>
<p>This section presents three popular methods of committing to particular research
questions or methods and avoiding potential criticisms of cherry-picking results
for publication: registration, preanalysis plans, and registered reports. Each
method involves documenting specific components of research design, ideally
before analyzing or extensively exploring the data. Study registration provides
formal notice that a study is being attempted and creates a hub for materials
and updates about the study results. Preanalysis plans constitute a more formal
commitment to use specific methods on particular questions. Writing and
releasing a preanalysis plan in advance of working with data help to protect the
credibility of approaches that have a high likelihood of producing false results
(<span class="citation">Wicherts et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-wicherts2016degrees" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>). Finally, registered reports allow researchers to approach
research design as a process subject to full peer review. Registered reports
enable close scrutiny of a research design, provide an opportunity for feedback
and improvement, and often result in a commitment to publish based on the
credibility of the design rather than on the specific results.</p>
<div id="registering-research" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Registering research<a href="reproducibility.html#registering-research" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Registration of research studies is an increasingly common practice, and more
journals are beginning to require registration of the studies they publish
(<span class="citation">Vilhuber, Turrito, and Welch (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-vilhuber2020report" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). <em>Study registration</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> is intended to ensure that
a complete record of research inquiry is readily available. Registering research
ensures that future scholars can quickly discover what work has been carried out
on a given question, even if some or all of the work done is never formally
published. Registration can be done before, during, or after a study is
completed, providing essential information about its purpose. Some currently
popular registries are operated by the American Economic Association (AEA; at
<a href="https://www.socialscienceregistry.org" class="uri">https://www.socialscienceregistry.org</a>), the International Initiative for
Impact Evaluation (3ie; at <a href="https://ridie.3ieimpact.org" class="uri">https://ridie.3ieimpact.org</a>), Evidence in
Governance and Politics (EGAP; at <a href="https://egap.org/content/registration" class="uri">https://egap.org/content/registration</a>), and
the Open Science Framework (OSF; at <a href="https://osf.io/registries" class="uri">https://osf.io/registries</a>). Each registry
has a different target audience and different features, so researchers can
select one that is appropriate to their work. Study registration should be
feasible for all projects, because registries are typically free to access and
initial registration can be submitted with minimal information. A generally
accepted practice is to revise and expand the level of detail gradually over
time, adding more information to the registry as the project progresses.</p>
<p><em>Preregistration</em> of studies before they begin is an extension of this principle
(<span class="citation">Nosek et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-nosek2018preregistration" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>). Registration of a study before implementation or data
acquisition starts provides a simple and low-effort way for researchers to
demonstrate that a particular line of inquiry was not generated by the process
of data collection or analysis itself, particularly when specific hypotheses are
included in the registration. Preregistrations need not provide exhaustive
details about how a particular hypothesis will be approached, only that it will
be. Preregistering individual elements of research design or analysis can
further strengthen the credibility of the research and requires only a minor
investment of time or administrative effort. For this reason, DIME requires all
studies to be preregistered in a public database and to specify at least some
primary hypotheses before providing funding for impact evaluation research. See
box 1.2 for a description of how the Demand for Safe Spaces project was
registered.</p>

<p>The experimental component of the Demand for Safe Spaces study was registered at
the Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations (RIDIE) under
identifier 5a125fecae423. The following are highlights from the registration:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Evaluation method.</em> Both a primary evaluation method (randomized control
trial) and additional methods (difference-in-differences and fixed effects
regressions) were included.</li>
<li><em>Key outcome variables.</em> Key variables were take-up of rides in women-only
car (binary), occurrence of harassment or crime during ride (binary),
self-reported well-being after each ride, overall subjective well-being, and
implicit association test D-score.</li>
<li><em>Primary hypotheses to be tested.</em> Riding in the women-only car reduces
harassment experienced by women; riding in the women-only car improves
psychological well-being; women are willing to forgo income to ride in the
women-only car.</li>
<li><em>Secondary research question and methods.</em> Supplementary research methods
(implicit association test and platform survey) were used to examine an
additional hypothesis: the women-only car is associated with a social norm
that assigns responsibility to women for avoiding harassment.</li>
<li><em>Sample size for each study arm.</em> The registration indicates the number of
individual participants, number of baseline rides, number of rides during
the price experiment, number of car-assigned rides, and number of expected
participants in the implicit association test.</li>
<li><em>Data sources.</em> The study relied on data previously collected (through the
mobile app) and data to be collected (through platform surveys and implicit
association tests).</li>
<li><em>Registration status.</em> The project was categorized as a nonprospective
entry, because the crowdsourced data had already been received and
processed. The team sought to ensure the credibility of additional data
collection and secondary research questions by registering the study.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing preanalysis plans<a href="reproducibility.html#writing-preanalysis-plans" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>If a research team has a large amount of flexibility to define how it will
approach a particular hypothesis, study registration may not be sufficient to
avoid the criticism of “hypothesizing after the results are known,” also known
as HARKing (<span class="citation">Kerr (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-kerr1998harking" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>). Examples of such flexibility include a broad range
of concrete measures that could each be argued to measure an abstract concept,
choices about sample inclusion or exclusion, or decisions about how to construct
derived indicators (Huntington-Klein et al. 2021). When researchers are
collecting a large amount of information and have leverage over even a moderate
number of these options, it is often possible to obtain almost any desired
result (<span class="citation">Gelman and Loken (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-gelman2013garden" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>A <em>preanalysis plan</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> (PAP) can be used to assuage
these concerns by specifying in advance a set of analyses that the researchers
intend to conduct. The PAP should be written up in detail for areas that are
known to provide a large amount of leeway for researchers to make decisions
later, particularly for areas such as interaction effects or subgroup analysis
(for an example, see <span class="citation">Cusolito, Dautovic, and McKenzie (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-cusolito2018can" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>). PAPs should not, however, be viewed as
binding the researcher’s hands (<span class="citation">Olken (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-olken2015promises" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>). Depending on what is known
about the study at the time of writing, PAPs can vary widely in the amount of
detail they include (McKenzie and Özler 2020). Various templates and checklists
provide details of what information to include (for a recommended checklist, see
<span class="citation">McKenzie (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-mckenzie2012beyond" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>). See box 1.3 for an example of how to prepare a PAP.</p>

<p>Although the Demand for Safe Spaces study did not publish a formal preanalysis
plan, it did publish a concept note in 2015, which included much of the same
information as a typical preanalysis plan. Prepared before fieldwork began, the
note was subject to review and approval within the World Bank and from a
technical committee, including blinded feedback from external academics. The
concept note was updated in May 2017 to include new secondary research
questions. The concept note specified the planned study along the following
dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Theory of change,</em> including the main elements of the intervention and the
hypothesized causal chain from inputs, through activities and outputs, to
outcomes</li>
<li><em>Hypotheses</em> derived from the theory of change</li>
<li><em>Main evaluation question(s)</em> to be addressed by the study</li>
<li><em>List of main outcomes of interest,</em> including name, definition, and level
of measurement of each of the outcome variables</li>
<li><em>Evaluation design,</em> including a precise description of the identification
strategy for each research question and a description of the treatment and
control groups</li>
<li><em>Sampling strategy and sample size calculation,</em> detailing the assumptions
made</li>
<li><em>Description of all quantitative data collection instruments</em></li>
<li><em>Data processing and analysis,</em> describing the statistical methods to be
used, the exact specification(s) to be run, including clustering of standard
errors, key groups for heterogeneity analysis, adjustments for testing
multiple hypotheses, and a strategy to test (and correct) for bias</li>
</ul>
<p>For a version of the study’s concept note, see <a href="https://git.io/JYatw" class="uri">https://git.io/JYatw</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The core function of a PAP is to describe carefully and explicitly one or more
specific data-driven inquiries, because specific formulations are often very
hard to justify retrospectively with data or projects that potentially provide
many avenues to approach a single theoretical question (for an example, see
<span class="citation">Bedoya et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-bedoya2019no" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>). Anything outside of the original plan is just as interesting and
valuable as it would have been if the plan had never been published, but having
precommitted to the details of a particular inquiry makes its results immune to
a wide range of criticisms of specification searching or multiple testing

<h3>Publishing registered reports<a href="reproducibility.html#publishing-registered-reports" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A <em>registered report</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> takes the process of prespecifying a
complex research design to the level of a formal publication. In a registered
report, a journal or other publisher will peer review and conditionally accept a
specific study for publication, typically guaranteeing the acceptance of a later
publication that carries out the analysis described in the registered report.
Although far stricter and more complex to carry out than ordinary study
registration or preanalysis planning, the registered report has the added
benefit of encouraging peer review and expert feedback on the design and
structure of the proposed study (Foster, Karlan, and Miguel 2018). Registered
reports are never required, but they are designed to reward researchers who are
able to provide a large amount of advance detail for their project, want to
secure publication interest regardless of results, or want to use methods that
may be novel or unusual.</p>
<p>Registered reports are meant to combat the “file-drawer problem” and ensure that
researchers are transparent in the sense that all of the promised results
obtained from registered-report studies are actually published (<span class="citation">Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-simonsohn2014p" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>).
This approach has the advantage of specifying in detail the project’s complete
research and analytical design and securing a commitment for publication
regardless of the outcome. This may be of special interest for researchers
studying events or programs for which there is a substantial risk that they will
not be able to publish a null or negative result (for an example, see
<span class="citation">Coville et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-coville2019nollywood" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>) or when they wish to avoid any pressure toward finding a
particular result—for example, when the program or event is the subject of
substantial social or political pressures. As with preregistration and
preanalysis, nothing in a registered report should be understood to prevent a
researcher from pursuing additional avenues of inquiry once the study is
complete, either in the same or in separate research outputs.</p>

<div id="conducting-research-transparently" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Conducting research transparently<a href="reproducibility.html#conducting-research-transparently" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Transparent research exposes not only the code but also also all the research
processes involved in developing the analytical approach. Such transparency
means that readers can judge for themselves whether the research was done well
and the decision-making process was sound. If the research is well structured
and all relevant <em>research documentation</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> is shared,
readers will be able to understand the analysis fully. Researchers who expect
the process to be transparent also have an incentive to make better decisions
and to be skeptical and thorough about their assumptions. They will also save
themselves time, because transparent research methods make coding more efficient
and prevent teams from having the same discussion multiple times.</p>
<p>Clearly documenting research work is necessary to allow others to evaluate
exactly what data were acquired and how the information was used to obtain a
particular result. Many development research projects are designed to address
specific questions and often use unique data, novel methods, or small samples.
These approaches can yield new insights into essential academic questions, but
they need to be documented transparently so they can be reviewed or replicated
by others in the future (<span class="citation">Duvendack, Palmer-Jones, and Reed (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-duvendack2017meant" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). Unlike disciplines in which data
are more standardized or research is more oriented toward secondary data, the
exact data used in a development research project often have not been observed
by anyone else in the past and may be impossible to collect again in the future.</p>
<p>Regardless of the novelty of study data, transparent documentation methods help
to ensure that data were collected and handled appropriately and that studies
and interventions were implemented correctly. As with study registrations,
project and data documentation should be released on external <em>archival
repositories</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> so that they can always be accessed and verified.</p>
<div id="documenting-data-acquisition-and-analysis" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Documenting data acquisition and analysis<a href="reproducibility.html#documenting-data-acquisition-and-analysis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Documenting a project in detail greatly increases transparency. Many disciplines
have a tradition of keeping a “lab notebook” (Pain 2019); adapting and expanding
this process to create a lab-style workflow in the development field are
critical steps toward more transparent practices. Transparency requires
explicitly noting decisions as they are made and explaining the process behind
the decision-making. Careful documentation also saves the research team a lot of
time; it avoids the need to have the same discussion twice (or more!), because
a record exists of why something was done in a particular way. Several tools are
available for producing documentation, and documenting a project should be an
active, ongoing process, not a one-time requirement or retrospective task. New
decisions are always being made as the plan becomes a reality, and there is
nothing wrong with sensible adaptation so long as it is recorded and disclosed.</p>
<p>Email, however, is <em>not</em> a documentation service, because communications are
rarely well ordered, can be easily deleted, and are not available for future
team members. At the very least, emails and other decision-making communications
need to be archived and preserved in an organized manner so that they can be
easily accessed and read by others in the future. Various software solutions are
available for building proper documentation over time. Some solutions work
better for keeping field records such as implementation decisions, research
design, and survey development; others work better for recording data work and
code development. The Open Science Framework (OSF; <a href="https://osf.io" class="uri">https://osf.io</a>) provides
one such solution, with integrated file storage, version histories, and
collaborative wiki pages. GitHub (<a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a>) provides a transparent
documentation system through commit messages, issues, <code>README.md</code> files, and
pull requests, in addition to version histories and wiki pages. Such services
offer multiple ways to record the decision making process leading to changes and
additions, to track and register discussions, and to manage tasks. (For more
details on how to use Git and GitHub and for links to all DIME Analytics
resources on best practices and how to get started, see the DIME Wiki at
<a href="https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Getting_started_with_GitHub" class="uri">https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Getting_started_with_GitHub</a>.)</p>
<p>These flexible tools can be adapted to different team and project dynamics.
Services that log the research process can show modifications made in response
to referee comments, by having tagged version histories at each major revision.
They also allow the use of issue trackers to document the research paths and
questions that the project tried to answer as a resource for others who have
similar questions. Each project has specific requirements for managing data,
code, and documentation; and the exact transparency tools to use will depend on
the team’s needs. In all cases, the tools should be chosen before project
launch, and a project’s documentation should begin as soon as decisions are
made.</p>
</div>
<div id="cataloging-and-archiving-data" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Cataloging and archiving data<a href="reproducibility.html#cataloging-and-archiving-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Data and data collection methods should be fully cataloged, archived, and
documented, whether the data are collected by the project itself or received
from an outside partner. In some cases, this process is as simple as uploading a
survey instrument or an index of data sets and a codebook to an archive. In
other cases, the process is more complex. Proper documentation of data
collection often requires a detailed description of the overall sampling
procedure (for an example, see <span class="citation">Yishay et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-yishay2016gender" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>). Settings with many
overlapping strata, treatment arms, excluded observations, or resampling
protocols might require extensive additional documentation. This documentation
should be continuously updated and kept with the other study materials; it is
often necessary to collate these materials for publication in an appendix.</p>
<p>When data are received from partners or collected in the field,
the <em>original data</em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> (including
field corrections) should be placed immediately in a secure permanent storage
system. Before analytical work begins, it is necessary to create a
“for-publication” copy of the acquired data set by removing all personally
identifying information. This copy will be the public version of the original
data set and must be placed in an archival repository where it can be cited
(<span class="citation">Vilhuber, Turrito, and Welch (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-vilhuber2020report" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). This type of data depositing or archiving precedes
publishing or releasing any data: data at this stage may still need to be
embargoed or have other, potentially permanent, access restrictions, so the
archive can be instructed formally to release the data later. If the planned
analysis requires the use of confidential data, those data should be stored
separately (and most likely remain encrypted) so that it is clear what portions
of the code will work with and without the restricted-access data.</p>
<p>Some institutions have their own dedicated data repositories, such as the World
Bank Microdata Library (<a href="https://microdata.worldbank.org" class="uri">https://microdata.worldbank.org</a>) and the World Bank
Data Catalog (<a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org" class="uri">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org</a>). Some project funders, such
as the U.S. Agency for International Development (<a href="https://data.usaid.gov" class="uri">https://data.usaid.gov</a>),
provide specific repositories in which they require the deposit of data they
have funded. Researchers should take advantage of these repositories when
possible. If no such service is provided, researchers must be aware of privacy
issues regarding directly identifying data and questions of data ownership
before uploading original data to any third-party server, whether public or not.
This is a legal question for the institutions affiliated with the principal
investigators. If the data required for analysis must be placed under restricted
use or restricted access, including data that can never be distributed directly
to third parties, a plan is needed for storing these data separately from
publishable data. Making such a plan maximizes transparency by having a clear
release package as well as by providing instructions or developing a protocol
for allowing access in the future for replicators or reviewers under appropriate
access agreements (for details on how to document this type of material, see
Vilhuber et al. 2020).</p>
<p>Regardless of restricted-access and confidentiality considerations, the selected
data repository should create a record of the data’s existence and provide
instructions for how another researcher might obtain access. More information on
the steps required to prepare and publish a de-identified data set are presented
in chapters 6 and 7. Data publication should create a data citation and a
<em>digital object identifier</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> (DOI) or some other
persistent index that can be used in future work to indicate unambiguously the
exact location of the data. The data publication package should also include
methodological documentation and complete human-readable codebooks for all of
the variables located there.</p>

<h2>Analyzing data reproducibly and preparing a reproducibility package<a href="reproducibility.html#analyzing-data-reproducibly-and-preparing-a-reproducibility-package" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>Reproducible research</em><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> makes
it easy for others to apply the techniques used in the project to new data or to
implement a similar research design in a different context. Development research
is moving rapidly in the direction of requiring adherence to specific
reproducibility guidelines (<span class="citation">Christensen and Miguel (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-christensen2018transparency" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>). Major publishers and
funders, most notably the American Economic Association, have taken steps to
require code and data to be reported accurately, cited, and preserved as
research outputs that can be accessed and verified by others. Making research
reproducible in this way is a public good. It enables other researchers to reuse
code and processes to do their own work more easily and effectively in the
future. Regardless of what is formally required, code should be written neatly,
with clear instructions. It should be easy to read and understand. The
corresponding analysis data also should be made accessible to the greatest legal
and ethical extent possible through <em>data publication</em><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Common research standards from journals and funders feature both regulation and
verification policies (<span class="citation">Stodden, Guo, and Ma (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-stodden2013toward" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>). Regulation policies require authors to
provide reproducibility packages before publication, which the journal then
reviews for completeness. Verification policies require authors to make certain
materials available to the public, but their completeness is not a precondition
for publication. Other journals provide guidance with checklists for reporting
on whether and how various practices were implemented, but do not require any
specific practices (<span class="citation">Nosek et al. (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-nosek2015promoting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>). Producing these kinds of resources also
has the advantage of creating additional opportunities for citations. Even if
privacy considerations mean that some or no data or results will be published,
these practices are still valuable for project organization.</p>
<p>Regardless of external requirements, it is important to prepare to release all
data that can be published. When data cannot be published, it is important to
publish as much metadata as allowed, including information on how the data were
obtained, what fields the data contain, and aggregations or descriptive
statistics. Even if the data cannot be published, code files rarely contain
restricted information, so the code should still be made available, with clear
instructions for obtaining usable data. Additionally, reproducibility demands
should be considered when designing the informed consent protocols or data
license agreement for sensitive data. Such efforts could include establishing
acceptable conditions (such as a secure transfer or cold room) under which third
parties may access data for the purpose of independently reproducing results.</p>
<p>At DIME, all published research outputs are required to satisfy <em>computational
reproducibility</em><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>.
Before releasing a working paper, the research team submits a reproducibility
package with de-identified data, and DIME Analytics verifies that the package
produces exactly the same results that appear in the paper (Andrade et
al. 2019). The team also assesses whether the package includes sufficient
documentation. Once the computational reproducibility check is complete, the
team receives a completed reproducibility certificate that also lists any
publicly available materials to accompany the package, for use as an appendix to
the publication. The DIME Analytics team organizes frequent peer reviews of code
for works in progress, and the general recommendation is to ensure that projects
are <em>always</em> externally reproducible instead of waiting until the final stages
to prepare this material. In this way, code is continuously maintained, clearly
documented, and easy to read and understand in terms of structure, style, and
syntax.</p>
<p>For research to be reproducible, all code files for data cleaning, construction,
and analysis should be public, unless they contain confidential information.
Nobody should have to guess exactly what a given index comprises, what controls
are included in the main regression, or whether standard errors are clustered
correctly. That is, as a purely technical matter, nobody should have to “just
trust you” or have to work to find out what would happen if any or all of these
tasks were done slightly differently (<span class="citation">Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-simonsohn2015specification" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>). Letting people
play around with a project’s data and code is a great way to have new questions
asked and answered on the basis of valuable work already done (Daniels et
al. 2019).</p>
<p>A reproducibility package should include the complete materials needed to
recreate the final analysis exactly and should be accessible and well documented
so that others can identify and adjust potential decision points in which they
are interested. They should be able to identify easily what data are used and
how the data can be accessed; what code generates each table, figure, and
in-text number; how key outcomes are constructed; and how all project results
can be reproduced. It is important to plan for reproducibility, because doing so
supports the researcher’s ability to obtain the proper documentation and
permissions for all data, code, and materials used throughout the project. A
well-organized reproducibility package usually takes the form of a complete
directory, including documentation and a <em>master script</em><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>. When considered in
combination with the corresponding publication, this package leads readers
through the process and rationale for the code behind each of the outputs. See
box 1.4 for an example of a reproducibility package.</p>

<h2>Looking ahead<a href="reproducibility.html#looking-ahead-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>With the ongoing rise of empirical research and increased public scrutiny of
scientific evidence, making analysis code and data available is necessary but
not sufficient to guarantee that findings will be credible. Even if the methods
used are highly precise, the evidence is only as good as the data—and plenty of
mistakes that would compromise the conclusions can be made between establishing
a design and generating final results. For this reason, transparency is key for
research credibility. It allows other researchers and research consumers to
verify the steps to reach a conclusion by themselves and decide whether their
standards for accepting a finding as evidence are met. Every investment made up
front in documentation and transparency protects the project down the line,
particularly as these standards continue to tighten. With these principles in
mind, the approach taken to the development, structure, and documentation of
data work in this handbook provides a system for implementing these ideas in
everyday work. The next chapter discusses the workspace needed to work in an
efficient, organized, secure, and reproducible manner.</p>
