<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 7</span> Publishing reproducible research outputs<a href="publication.html#publication" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Publishing research typically involves preparing many iterations of data, code,
and code output files, with inputs from multiple collaborators. This process can
quickly become unwieldy. It is in nobody’s interest for a skilled and busy
researcher to spend days renumbering figures, tables, or references when a
reasonable amount of up-front effort can automate the task. Similarly,
simultaneous collaboration should not involve the repetitive and error-prone
task of manually resolving sets of track-change documents with conflicting
edits. Furthermore, for most development research projects, a working paper or a
policy brief is not the end of the publication stage. Academic journals and
research consumers increasingly require reproducibility packages containing the
data, code, and supporting materials needed to recreate the results. All working
papers resulting from DIME projects are required to produce a reproducibility
package and pass a reproducibility check. Replication materials make an
intellectual contribution in their own right, because they enable others to
learn from the process and better understand the results obtained. If the
analysis process is organized according to the general principles outlined in
earlier chapters, publication will not require substantial reorganization of the
work already done. Hence, publication is the culmination of the system of
transparent, reproducible, and credible research introduced in the first chapter
of this book.</p>
<p>This chapter recommends tools and workflows for efficiently managing
collaboration on research and policy outputs and ensuring reproducible results.
The first section discusses how to use dynamic documents to collaborate on
writing. The second section covers how to prepare and publish original data, an
important research contribution in its own right. The third section provides
guidelines for preparing functional and informative reproducibility packages.
In all cases, technology is evolving rapidly, and the specific tools noted here
may not remain cutting edge, but the core principles involved in publication
and transparency will endure. Box 7.1 summarizes the main points, lists the
responsibilities of different members of the research team, and supplies a list
of key tools and resources for implementing the recommended practices.</p>

<h2>Publishing research papers and reports<a href="publication.html#publishing-research-papers-and-reports" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Development research is increasingly a collaborative effort. This trend reflects
changes in the economics discipline overall: the number of sole-authored
research outputs is decreasing, and the majority of recent papers in top
journals have three or more authors (<span class="citation">Kuld and O’Hagan (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-kuldtrend">2017</a>)</span>). As a consequence,
documents typically pass back and forth between several writers before they are
ready for publication or release. As in all other stages of the research
process, effective collaboration requires the adoption of tools and practices
that enable version control and simultaneous contributions. This book, for
example, was written in dynamic document formats (LaTeX and Markdown) and
managed on GitHub. All the versions and the history of changes can be viewed at
<a href="https://github.com/worldbank/dime-data-handbook" class="uri">https://github.com/worldbank/dime-data-handbook</a>. As outlined in chapter 6,
<em>dynamic documents</em> are a way to simplify writing workflows: updates to code
outputs that appear in these documents, such as tables and figures, can be
passed into the final research output with a single click, rather than being
copied and pasted or otherwise handled individually. Managing the writing
process in this way improves organization and reduces error, such that there is
no risk that materials will be compiled with out-of-date results or that
completed work will be lost or redundant.</p>
<div id="using-latex-for-written-documents" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Using LaTeX for written documents<a href="publication.html#using-latex-for-written-documents" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As discussed in chapter 6, LaTeX is currently the most widely used software for
dynamically managing formal manuscripts and policy outputs. It is also becoming
more popular for shorter documents, such as policy briefs, with the
proliferation of skills and templates for these kinds of products. LaTeX uses
explicit references to the file path of each code output (such as tables and
figures), which are reloaded from these locations every time the final document
is compiled. This is not possible by default in, for example, Microsoft Word.
There, you have to copy and paste each object whenever tables, graphs, or other
inputs are updated. As time goes on, it becomes increasingly likely that a
mistake will be made or something will be missed. In LaTeX, instead of writing
in a “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” mode as is done in Word, writing is done in
plain text in a <code>.tex</code> file, interlaced with coded instructions formatting the
document and linking to exhibits (similar to HTML). LaTeX manages tables and
figures dynamically and includes commands for simple markup such as font styles,
paragraph formatting, section headers, and the like. It includes special
controls for footnotes and endnotes, mathematical notation, and bibliography
preparation. It also allows publishers to apply global styles and templates to
written material, reformatting entire documents in a house style with only a few
keystrokes.</p>
<p>Although LaTeX <em>can</em> produce complex formatting, such formatting is rarely
needed for academic publishing because academic manuscripts are usually
reformatted according to the style of the publisher. (Researchers creating
policy briefs and other self-produced documents may desire extensive typesetting
and investments in custom templates and formatting.) In academia at least, it is
rarely worth the investment to go beyond basic LaTeX tools: the title page,
sections and subsections, figures and tables, mathematical equations, bolding
and italics, footnotes and endnotes, and, last but not least, references and
citations. Many of these functionalities, including dynamic updating of some
outputs, can be achieved in Microsoft Word through the use of plugins and
careful workflows. If it is possible to maintain such a workflow, then this
approach is acceptable, but moving toward the adoption of LaTeX is recommended
when possible.</p>
<p>One of the most important tools available in LaTeX is the BibTeX citation and
bibliography manager (<span class="citation">Kopka and Daly (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-kopka1995guide">1995</a>)</span>). BibTeX keeps all of the references that
might be used in a <code>.bib</code> file and then references them using a simple command
typed directly in the document. Specifically, LaTeX inserts references in text
using the <code>cite</code> command. Once this is written, LaTeX automatically pulls all
the citations into text and creates a complete bibliography based on the
citations used to compile the document. The system makes it possible to specify
exactly how references should be displayed in text (for example, as superscripts
or as inline references) as well as how the bibliography should be styled and in
what order (such as Chicago, Modern Language Association, Harvard, or other
common styles). The same principles that apply to figures and tables are
therefore applied here: references are changed in one place (the <code>.bib</code> file), and
then everywhere they are used they are updated consistently with a single
process. BibTeX is used so widely that it is natively integrated in Google
Scholar. Because different publishers have different requirements, it is quite
useful to be able to adapt this and other formatting very quickly, including
through publisher-supplied templates where available.</p>
<p>Because it follows a standard code format, LaTeX has one more useful trick: the
ability to convert raw documents into Word or several other formats using
utilities such as <code>pandoc</code>, a free and open-source document converter
(<a href="https://pandoc.org" class="uri">https://pandoc.org</a>). Even though conversion to Word is required for some
academic publishers and can even be preferred for some policy outputs, using
LaTeX to prepare these products is still recommended. Exporting to Word should
be done only at the final stage, when submitting materials. A <code>.csl</code> file
(<a href="https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles" class="uri">https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles</a>), which styles the
citations in a document, can also be applied automatically in this process so
references follow the style of nearly any journal desired. Therefore, even if it
is necessary to provide <code>.docx</code> versions or track-change versions of materials
to others, these versions can be created effortlessly from a LaTeX document
using external tools like Word’s compare feature to generate integrated
trackchange versions when needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-started-with-latex-as-a-team" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Getting started with LaTeX as a team<a href="publication.html#getting-started-with-latex-as-a-team" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Although starting to use LaTeX may be challenging, it offers valuable control
over the writing process. Because it is written in a plain-text file format,
<code>.tex</code> can be version-controlled using Git. Contributions and version histories
can be managed using the same system recommended for data work. DIME Analytics
has created a variety of templates and resources that can be adapted to
different needs, available at
<a href="https://github.com/worldbank/DIME-LaTeX-Templates" class="uri">https://github.com/worldbank/DIME-LaTeX-Templates</a>. Integrated editing and
compiling tools like TeXstudio (<a href="https://www.texstudio.org" class="uri">https://www.texstudio.org</a>) and <code>atom-latex</code>
(<a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-latex" class="uri">https://atom.io/packages/atom-latex</a>) offer the most flexibility to work with
LaTeX in teams.</p>
<p>Although ultimately worth the effort, setting up LaTeX environments locally is
not always simple, particularly for researchers who are new to working with
plain-text code and file management. LaTeX requires all formatting to be done in
its special code language and is not always informative when something has been
done wrong. This situation can be off-putting very quickly for people who simply
want to begin writing, and those who are not used to programming may find it
difficult to acquire the necessary knowledge.</p>
<p>Cloud-based implementations of LaTeX can make it easier for the team to use
LaTeX without all members having to invest in new skills or set up matching
software environments; they can be particularly useful for first forays into
LaTeX writing. One example of cloud-based implementation is Overleaf
(<a href="https://www.overleaf.com" class="uri">https://www.overleaf.com</a>). Most such sites offer a subscription feature with
useful extensions and various sharing permissions, and some offer free-to-use
versions with basic tools that are sufficient for a broad variety of
applications, up to and including writing a complete academic paper with
coauthors.</p>
<p>Cloud-based implementations of LaTeX have several advantageous features for
teams compared to classic desktop installations. First, because they are hosted
completely online, they avoid the inevitable troubleshooting required to set up
a LaTeX installation on various personal computers run by different members of a
team. Second, they typically maintain a single, continuously synced copy of the
document so that different writers do not create conflicted or out-of-sync
copies or need to deal with Git themselves to maintain that sync. Third, they
typically allow collaborators to edit documents simultaneously, although
different services vary the number of collaborators and documents allowed at
each subscription tier. Fourth, some implementations provide a “rich text”
editor that behaves similarly to familiar tools like Word, so that collaborators
can write text directly into the document without worrying too much about the
underlying LaTeX coding. Cloud services usually offer a convenient selection of
templates so it is easy to start a project and see results right away without
knowing a lot of the code that controls document formatting.</p>
<p>Cloud-based implementations of LaTeX also have disadvantages. Some up-front
learning is still required, except when using the rich text editor. Continuous
access to the internet is necessary, and updating figures and tables may require
a file upload that can be tough to automate. Although some services offer ways
to track changes and even to integrate a Git workflow, version control is not as
straightforward as using Git locally. Finally, cloud-based services also vary
dramatically in their ability to integrate with file systems that store code and
code outputs, and it is necessary to practice an integrated workflow depending
on what is available. Some teams adopt cloud-based tools as a permanent
solution, although DIME recommends shifting eventually to local editing and
compiling using tools such as TexStudio, while using Git for version control.

<h2>Preparing research data for publication<a href="publication.html#preparing-research-data-for-publication" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Although the focus so far has been on written materials, it is also necessary to
consider how to publish the data used in research. The open science community
views <em>data publication</em><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> both as a
citable output and as a necessary transparency measure. Fortunately, it is a
conceptually simple task to produce and catalog the required materials. Two
separate collections should be cataloged. First, it is necessary to catalog the
clean data with all of the variables corresponding directly to fields in the
original data set or data collection instrument (this step is not required if
the data are secondary data not produced by the team, but explaining carefully
the process of acquiring the data is necessary). At the publication stage, if
the steps outlined in chapter 5 have been followed, a cleaned data set and
supporting documentation will be ready. Projects that did not follow these steps
from the beginning, but still need to organize a data release, will find
valuable advice in (<span class="citation">Dupriez and Greenwell (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-dupriez2007">2007</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to catalog separately the analysis data set used for the
research output being published. This data set is typically included in the
replication package for the research output (for an example, see box 7.3). The
package should also include the data construction scripts that created
transformed and derived indicators, project-specific information such as
treatment assignment, and other indicators generated directly by the research
team (constructed record linkages are another example). If the workflow
recommended in chapter 6 has been followed, all of the necessary files and
documentation will be at hand when the publication stage is reached.</p>
<div id="de-identifying-data-for-publication" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>De-identifying data for publication<a href="publication.html#de-identifying-data-for-publication" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Before publishing data, it is important to perform a careful <em>final
de-identification</em>. The objective is to reduce the risk of disclosing
confidential information in the published data set. Following the workflow
outlined in this book, direct identifiers were removed as a first step after
acquiring the data (see the discussion of initial de-identification in
chapter 5). For the final de-identification, indirect identifiers are also
removed, and the statistical <em>disclosure risk</em><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> of the data is assessed. Unlike direct identifiers,
for which a link (or lack thereof) to public information is verifiable, indirect
identifiers require an assessment of the likelihood that an individual can be
singled out in the data and then linked to public information using combinations
of available data. For example, seemingly innocuous variables such as US zip
code, gender, and date of birth uniquely identify approximately 87 percent of
the US population (<span class="citation">Sweeney (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Sweeney2000">2000</a>)</span>). In development data, information such as the
size of a household, the age and marital status of household members, and the
types of work or schooling they engage in may be more than enough to identify a
person or family from a sufficiently small group.</p>
<p>Some tools have been developed to help researchers to de-identify data. For
example, the <code>sdcMicro</code> package (<span class="citation">Benschop and Welch (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-benschop2019statistical">n.d.</a>)</span>) has a useful feature
for assessing the uniqueness of records. It produces simple measures of the
identifiability of records from the combination of potentially indirectly
identifying variables and the application of common information-masking
algorithms, such as binning, top-coding, and jittering data before release. At
this stage, it is necessary to determine how sensitive the results are to these
transformations; it may be that masked data cannot be used for the
reproducibility package.</p>
<p>There is almost always a trade-off between accuracy and privacy. For publicly
disclosed data, privacy should be favored. Stripping identifying variables from
a data set may not be sufficient to protect the privacy of respondents, because
of the risk of re-identification. One solution is to add noise to the data, as
the US Census Bureau has proposed (<span class="citation">Abowd (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-abowd2018us">2018</a>)</span>). This solution makes explicit
the trade-off between data accuracy and privacy. But there are, as of yet, no
established norms for such “differential privacy” approaches: most approaches
fundamentally rely on judging “how harmful” information disclosure would be. The
fact remains that there is always a balance between the release of information
(and therefore transparency) and the protection of privacy, and this balance
should be examined actively and explicitly. The best step is to compile a
complete record of the steps that have been taken so that the process can be
reviewed, revised, and updated as necessary.</p>
<p>Removing variables results in loss of information, so the de-identification
process requires careful assessment of the potential risk that could be caused
by disclosure of a person’s identity or personal information. This risk varies
widely, depending on the types of information collected and the overall
vulnerability of the population. In extreme cases, such as when the population
is highly vulnerable and combinations of information are highly specific, it may
not be possible to release any data publicly at all. It is still necessary to
catalog and cite the data, even if the information cannot be released publicly.
In practice, this situation may mean publishing only a catalog entry providing
information about the content of the data sets and how future users might
request permission to access them (even if someone else will grant that
permission). In some cases, it may be possible to release the data set but to
embargo specific variables that are required for the analysis but cannot be
released publicly. It may be necessary to grant access to the embargoed data for
specific purposes, such as a computational reproducibility check required for
publication, if done under careful data security protocols and approved by an
institutional review board.</p>

<h3>Publishing research data sets<a href="publication.html#publishing-research-data-sets" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Publicly documenting all original data acquired as part of a research project is
an important contribution in its own right. Cataloging or archiving original
data sets makes a significant contribution in addition to any publication of
analysis results. Publicly releasing data allows other researchers to validate
the mechanical construction of results, investigate what other results might be
obtained from the same population, and test alternative approaches or answer
other questions. It fosters collaboration and may enable researchers to explore
variables and questions that the team did not have time to address.</p>
<p>The first step toward data publication is choosing the platform for publication.
Various options exist; it is important to choose one that provides a digital
object identifier (DOI) for the location of the data—even if its URL changes—and
a formal citation for the data so that the information can be cited in other
research outputs (<a href="https://www.doi.org" class="uri">https://www.doi.org</a>). Two common platforms for development
data are the World Bank’s Development Data Hub and Harvard University’s
Dataverse. The World Bank’s Development Data Hub
(<a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org" class="uri">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org</a>) includes a Microdata Catalog and a
Geospatial Catalog, where researchers can publish data and documentation for
their projects (the Demand for Safe Spaces data were published in the Microdata
Catalog, as detailed in box 7.3). The Harvard Dataverse
(<a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu" class="uri">https://dataverse.harvard.edu</a>) publishes both data and code, and its Datahub
for Field Experiments in Economics and Public Policy
(<a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/DFEEP" class="uri">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/DFEEP</a>) is especially relevant for
publishing impact evaluations. Both the World Bank Microdata Catalog and the
Harvard Dataverse create data citations for deposited entries. DIME has its own
collection of data sets in the Microdata Catalog, accessible at
<a href="https://microdata.worldbank.org/catalog/dime" class="uri">https://microdata.worldbank.org/catalog/dime</a>, where data from DIME projects
are published.</p>
<div id="box-7.3-publishing-research-data-sets-a-case-study-from-the-demand-for-safe-spaces-project" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor ex">
<h4>BOX 7.3 PUBLISHING RESEARCH DATA SETS: A CASE STUDY FROM THE DEMAND FOR SAFE SPACES PROJECT<a href="publication.html#box-7.3-publishing-research-data-sets-a-case-study-from-the-demand-for-safe-spaces-project" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The final analysis data sets used in the Demand for Safe Spaces working paper
were published in the World Bank’s Microdata Catalog under survey ID number
BRA_2015-2016_DSS_v01_M. Three separate data sets in Stata format are
present: one with the platform survey data, one with riders’ observations, and
one with supplemental crowding information. The entry also contains extensive
documentation, including a study description, a list of the staff involved in
data collection, all questionnaires used to collect data present in the analysis
data set, outputs produced using the data, survey protocols, ethics protocols,
and a data dictionary. Access is licensed, so anyone who is interested in
downloading the data needs to request access to them, and the data are made
available only after the authors approve this request. However, even without
downloading the data, users can explore the distribution of each variable. The
entry includes a template citation to be used whenever the data are referenced.
Finally, a clear and transparent version-control system allows viewers to see
when the data were first published and when they were last modified. See the
Microdata Catalog entry at
<a href="https://microdatalib.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/11600" class="uri">https://microdatalib.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/11600</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Once a platform has been chosen, it is time to determine exactly what data will
be published. As mentioned earlier, there are typically two types of data
releases for a research project: complete (de-identified) original data sets and
derivative data sets used for specific research outputs. Whether the original
data set can be published depends on data ownership and licensing agreements. If
the data were acquired through a survey that was contracted by the research
team, the data most likely belong to the research team, and therefore the team
has publication rights to both the original and the derivative data. If data
were acquired from a partner through a licensing agreement, the terms of the
license will determine publication rights. These data sets should match the
survey instrument or source documentation as closely as possible and should not
include indicators constructed by the research team. Releasing constructed data
is often more straightforward; depending on data licensing, researchers who do
not have rights to publish the original data may be able to publish derivative
data sets prepared by the research team. These data sets usually contain only
the constructed indicators and associated documentation and should also be
included in the replication package.</p>
<p>When data are published, how they may be used and what license will be assigned
to them have to be determined. It is essential to understand the rights
associated with any data release and to communicate them to future users.
Material without a license may never be reused. It is best to offer a license
that is explicit and details whether and how specific individuals may access the
data. Terms of use available in the World Bank Microdata Catalog include, in
order of increasing restrictiveness: open access, direct access, and licensed
access. <em>Open access</em> data are freely available to anyone and simply require
attribution. <em>Direct access</em> data are available to registered users who agree to
use the data for statistical and scientific research purposes only, to cite the
data appropriately, and not to attempt to identify respondents or data providers
or link the data to other data sets that could allow for reidentification.
<em>Licensed access</em> data are restricted to users who submit a documented
application detailing how they will use the data and who sign a formal agreement
governing data use. The user must be acting on behalf of an organization, which
will be held responsible for any misconduct. (See
<a href="https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/terms-of-use" class="uri">https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/terms-of-use</a> for more details.)</p>
<p>Published data should be released in a widely recognized format. Although
software-specific data sets are acceptable accompaniments to the code (because
those precise materials are probably necessary), releasing data sets in
plain-text formats, such as <code>.csv</code> files, with accompanying codebooks should be
considered, because any researcher can use these files. Additionally, <code>.pdf</code> or
code versions of the data collection instrument or survey questionnaire should
be released so that readers can understand which data components are collected
directly in the field and which are derived. Together with the analysis data
set, the code that constructs any derived measures from the clean data set
should be released, so that others can learn from the work and adapt it as they
like.</p>

<div id="publishing-a-reproducible-research-package" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Publishing a reproducible research package<a href="publication.html#publishing-a-reproducible-research-package" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Major journals often require researchers to provide both the data and the code
required to recreate the results. Some even require the ability to reproduce the
results themselves before they will approve a paper for publication
(<span class="citation">Vilhuber, Turrito, and Welch (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-vilhuber2020report">2020</a>)</span>). Researchers who are producing a policy output, such as an
open policy analysis (<span class="citation">Hoces de la Guardia, Grant, and Miguel (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-hoces2018framework">2018</a>)</span>) or some other type of material (for
example, see Andrade et al. 2019; Castaneda Aguilar, Debebe, and de Simone 2020;
World Bank 2018) may also want to make their materials publicly reproducible.
Even if the work is meant for use only inside the sponsoring organization,
having a final set of production materials is still a valuable output. This set
of materials, taken together, is often referred to as a <em>reproducibility package</em>.
If the workflows described in this book have been followed, preparing the
replication package will require only a small amount of extra work. If not,
creating this package may take time. When the replication package has been
completed, anyone who downloads it should be able to understand how the code
produces results from the data and be able to reproduce them exactly by
executing the included master script.</p>
<div id="organizing-code-for-reproducibility" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Organizing code for reproducibility<a href="publication.html#organizing-code-for-reproducibility" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Before the code is released, it should be edited for content and clarity just as
if it were written material. The purpose of releasing code is to allow others to
understand exactly what was done to obtain the results and to enable them to
apply similar methods in future projects. Other researchers should be able to
reproduce individual portions of the analysis by making only small adjustments
to the code. In either a scripts folder or the root directory, a master script
should be included to allow someone else to run the entire project and recreate
all raw code outputs by changing only a single line of code setting the root
directory path. The code should be both functional and readable, through the use
of a clear structure and extensive commenting. Code is often not written this
way when it is first prepared, so it is important to review the content and
organization so that a new reader can figure out what the code should do and how
it does it. It is necessary to invest sufficient time in making code clean and
readable before releasing the reproducibility package.</p>
<p>DIME requires all academic outputs to pass a computational reproducibility check
before being submitted for publication. Several practices and requirements have
been adopted to support the production of high-quality reproducibility packages.
The materials for these practices are publicly available and are useful for
checking the reproducibility of work. This reproducibility check is initiated by
submitting a reproducibility package checklist, which is available in Pillar 3
of the DIME Standards GitHub repository at
<a href="https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards" class="uri">https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards</a>. DIME projects are required to
organize code with a master script, to facilitate handovers across team members,
and to make the computational reproducibility check a one-click exercise.
Compliance with these and other coding standards at DIME is monitored through
quarterly rounds of peer code reviews, which allow research assistants to
improve their code and documentation as they are written, rather than having to
revisit them in a rush near publication time. DIME projects are also expected to
use Git and GitHub to document project work and collaboration and to keep the
main branch up-to-date as a working edition.</p>
<p>Before a reproducibility package is publicly released, it is essential to make
sure that the code runs and produces the same results on the current setup and
on a fresh installation of the software. To ensure that code will run completely
on a new computer, any required user-written commands in the master script have
to be installed. In Stata, the commands <code>ssc install</code> or <code>net install</code> can be
used to install them. In R, options include the base command <code>install.packages</code>
and functions in the <code>pacman</code> package. Remember to indicate the package version
if relevant (in R, the <code>renv</code> package helps with tracking package versions). In
Stata, it may be preferrable to provide the underlying code for any
user-installed packages needed to ensure forward compatibility. System settings
like software version and memory used may also need to be defined when using
Stata. The <code>ieboilstart</code><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> command defines and applies these
settings for a chosen Stata version.</p>
<p>Finally, code inputs and outputs need to be identified clearly. A new user
should, for example, be able to find and quickly recreate any files generated by
the code, locate an output in the code, and correspond code to its outputs. Code
should be broken into separate scripts as much as possible to minimize the need
to search through long files. Someone reading the code should be able to figure
out fairly easily what state the program will be in at any point without
scrolling through hundreds of lines; similarly, they should not have to look in
different files or faraway sections of code to make changes to outputs. Each
file should be an understandable, independent selection of related processes.
Readers should also be able to map all of the outputs of the code easily to
where they appear in the associated published material, so it is necessary to
ensure that the raw components of figures or tables are identified. For example,
code outputs should correspond by name to an exhibit in the paper and vice
versa. Documentation in the master script is often used to indicate this
information, and supplying a compiling LaTeX document can also support this
task. Code and code outputs not used in the final paper should be removed from
the final replication package and archived for transparency.</p>

<div id="releasing-a-reproducibility-package" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Releasing a reproducibility package<a href="publication.html#releasing-a-reproducibility-package" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Once the replication package has been prepared for public release, it is time to
find a place to publish the materials. At the time of writing this handbook,
there is no consensus on the best solution for publishing code, and different
archives and storage providers cater to different needs. The technologies
available are likely to change dramatically over the next few years; this
section highlights the strengths and weaknesses of some current approaches.</p>
<p>Features to look for in a platform on which to release reproducibility packages
include the possibility to store data and documentation as well as code, the
creation of a static copy of content that cannot be changed or removed, and the
assignment of a permanent DOI. Unlike data, code usually has few external
constraints to publication. The research team owns the code in almost all cases,
and code is unlikely to contain identifying information (though it is important
to verify that it does not). Publishing code also requires assigning a license
to it; most code publishers offer permissive licensing options. In the absence
of a license, no one can reuse the code. It is common to, at most, require
attribution and citation for reuse, without any barriers or restrictions to code
access.</p>
<p>GitHub is one option for creating and releasing a reproducibility package.
Making a public GitHub repository is free. The repository can hold any type of
file; provide a structured, compressed download of the whole project; and allow
others to look at alternate versions or histories. It is straightforward to
upload a fixed directory to GitHub, apply a sharing license, and obtain a URL
for the whole package. There is a strict size restriction of 100 megabytes per
file and 100 gigabytes for the repository as a whole, so larger projects will
need alternative solutions. However, GitHub is not the ideal platform on which
to publish reproducibility packages. It is built to version-control code and to
facilitate collaboration on it. It is not an archive, meaning that it does not
guarantee the permanence of uploaded materials or the access URL, and it does
not manage citations or noncode licenses by default. One suggestion is to
combine GitHub with Zenodo (<a href="https://zenodo.org" class="uri">https://zenodo.org</a>) or the Open Science Framework
(OSF; <a href="https://osf.io" class="uri">https://osf.io</a>), which can link easily to and import material from
GitHub and apply a permanent URL, DOI, formal citation, general license, and
archival services to it. Other options include the Harvard Dataverse and
ResearchGate (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net" class="uri">https://www.researchgate.net</a>).</p>
<p>Any of the aforementioned archival services is acceptable—the main requirement
is that the system can handle the structured directory being submitted and that
it can provide a stable URL for the project and report exactly what, if any,
modifications have been made since initial publication. It is even possible to
combine more than one tool, as long as the tools clearly reference each other.
For example, code and the corresponding license can be published on GitHub,
while referring to data published on the World Bank Microdata Catalog. Emerging
technologies such as the “containerization” approach of CodeOcean
(<a href="https://codeocean.com" class="uri">https://codeocean.com</a>) offer to store both code and data in one repository
and also provide an online workspace in which others can execute and modify code
without having to download the tools and match the local environment used to
create it.</p>
<p>In addition to code and data, an author’s copy or preprint of the article
itself could be released along with these materials, but it is important to
check with the publisher before doing so; not all journals will accept material
that has been publicly released before its formal publication date, although, in
most development research fields, the release of working papers is a fairly
common practice. This release can be done on preprint websites, many of which
are topic specific. It is also possible to use GitHub or OSF and link to the PDF
file directly through a personal website or whatever medium is sharing the
preprint. Using file-sharing services such as Dropbox or Google Drive is not
recommended for this purpose, because their access is more restrictive, and
organizations often restrict access to such platforms.</p>
<p>Finally, any reproducibility package should include an overview of its contents
and instructions on how to recreate outputs. Box 7.4 describes how the Demand
for Safe Spaces project released its reproducibility package. This overview is
typically provided in the form of a <code>README</code> file. A good <code>README</code> file guides
the reader through all of the items included in the package. Fortunately, a
consortium of social science data editors offers a very good template for such
documents, which can be found at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4319999" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4319999</a>.</p>

<p>This chapter described the culmination of all of the efforts involved in
acquiring, cleaning, processing, and analyzing data—the production of materials
to share with the world that answer a scientific or policy question in a way
that has never been done before. Figure 7.1 provides an overview of the outputs
created by this process. Making sure that everything that was discovered and
created is as broadly available and as easy to use as possible is the last step
in producing scientific evidence from original data. This assurance is the
purpose of all the rigor, organization, and documentation that are encouraged
and detailed at every step of the process: because all of the research materials
are continuously organized, shareable, secure, documented, and readable, they
are both valuable to the research team and accessible to others.</p>
