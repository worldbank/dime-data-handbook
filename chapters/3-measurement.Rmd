# Establishing a measurement framework {#measurement}

The first step in the data workflow is to establish a measurement framework,
which requires understanding a project’s data requirements and how to structure
the required data to answer the research questions. Setting up the measurement
framework involves more than simply listing the key outcome variables. It is
also necessary to understand how to structure original data, to determine how
different data sources connect together, and to create tools to document these
decisions and communicate them to the full research team. This chapter shows how
to develop this framework and demonstrates that planning in advance saves time
and improves the quality of research.

The first section of this chapter introduces the DIME data map template. The
template includes a data linkage table, master data sets, and data flowcharts.
These tools are used to communicate the project’s data requirements across the
team and over time. The second section describes how to translate a project’s
research design into data needs. It provides examples of the specific data
required by common types of impact evaluation research designs and how to
document the link between research design and data sources in the data map
template. The final section links the measurement framework to the
reproducibility and credibility pillars introduced in chapter 1. It covers how
to generate research design variables that are reproducible and how to use power
calculations and randomization inference to assess credibility. Box 3.1
summarizes the most important points, lists the responsibilities of different
members of the research team, and provides a list of key tools and resources for
implementing the recommended practices.

#### BOX 3.1 SUMMARY: ESTABLISHING A MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK {-}

To be useful for research, original data must be mapped to a research design
through a measurement framework. The measurement framework links each of the
project’s data sets to the research design and establishes their connections and
relationships. Elaborating the measurement framework at the start of a research
project ensures that all team members have the same understanding and creates
documentation that will prove useful over the full research cycle. The
measurement framework includes three key outputs.

1.  *Data map*. The data map documents all of the data for the project. The
    materials in the data map provide documentation for

  - All data sets, units of observation, and high-level relationships between
    data sets, which are provided in a data linkage table;
  - The master data sets for each unit of observation, which define the
    statistical populations of interest; and
  - The expected ways in which data sets will be combined in data processing and
    analysis, with data flowcharts as a visual guide.


2.  *Research design variables*. The research design variables, which translate
    the research design into data, describe characteristics like the following:

  - Treatment and sampling variables, such as comparison groups, clusters and
    strata, and other variables, which describe how units of observation relate
    to the proposed analytical methodology
  - Time variables, which may be regular or irregular and serve to structure the
    data temporally
  - Monitoring indicators, which characterize the implementation of
    interventions or surveys


3.  *Outputs of random processes*. Random processes, implemented through
    statistical software, are often needed to translate research designs into
    data work. These random processes share common characteristics and can
    include the following:

  - Random sampling, to choose a subset of the population of interest to observe
  - Random treatment assignment, to determine which units will be placed into
    which experimental condition in a randomized trial
  - More complex designs, such as clustering or stratification, which require
    special considerations

#### Key responsibilities for task team leaders and principal investigators{-}

  - Oversee and provide inputs to the development of data linkage tables, master
    data set(s), and data flowchart(s); and review and approve the complete data
    map.
  - Supervise the generation of all research design variables required to
    execute the study design, and establish guidelines for any research design
    variables that require data collection.
  - Provide detailed guidance on the expected function and structure of random
    processes.

#### Key responsibilities for research assistants{-}

  - Develop all components of the data map template, and maintain them
    throughout the project life cycle, documenting any changes to the structure
    of data or units of observation.
  - Understand the study design and how it translates to the project’s data
    structure.
  - Generate all research design variables transparently and reproducibly,
    taking care to follow the best-practice protocols for random processes.

## Documenting data needs {-}

Most projects require more than one data source to answer a research question.
Data could be sourced from multiple survey rounds, acquired from various
partners (such as administrative data or implementation data), acquired from
technological tools like satellite imagery or web scraping, or sourced from
complex combinations of these and other sources (for an example, see
@kondylis2018speed). Regardless of how the study data are structured, it is
essential to know how to link data from all sources and analyze the
relationships between units to answer the research questions. It is not possible
to keep all of the relevant details straight without a structured process
because the whole research team is unlikely to have the same understanding, over
the whole life cycle of the project, of the relationship between all of the
required data sets. To ensure that the full team shares the same understanding,
best practice is to create a *data map*^[A **data map** is a set of tools to
document and communicate the data requirements in a project and how different
data can be linked together. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Map.]. The data map is intended to ensure
that all of the data are in hand to answer the intended research questions, well
before starting the analysis described in chapter 6. The data map provides
documentation for the project. The process of drafting the data map provides a
useful opportunity for principal investigators to communicate their vision of
the data structure and requirements and for research assistants to communicate
their understanding of that vision. The recommended best practice is to complete
the data map before acquiring any data and to make it part of the
preregistration of the study. However, in practice many research projects evolve
as new data sources, observations, and research questions arise, which means
that each component of the data map has to be maintained and updated
continuously.

The DIME data map template has three components: one data linkage table, one or
several master data sets, and one or several data flowcharts. The *data linkage
table*^[The **data linkage table** is the component of a data map that lists
all the data sets in a particular project and explains how they are linked to
each other. For more details and an example, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Linkage_Table.] lists all of the original
data sets that will be used in the project, what data sources they are created
from, and how they relate to each other. For each unit of observation in the
data linkage table as well as for each unit of analysis to be used, a *master
data set*^[A **master data set** is the component of a data map that lists all
individual units for a given level of observation in a project. For more details
and an example, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Master_Data_Set.] is created and maintained,
listing all observations of the unit that are relevant to the project. Finally,
using these two resources, *data flowcharts*^[A **data flowchart** is the
component of a data map that lists how the data sets acquired for the project
are intended to be combined to create the data sets used for analysis. For more
details and an example, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Flow_Charts.] are created, describing how
the original data sets and master data sets are to be combined and transformed
to create analysis data sets. Each component is discussed in more detail in the
following subsections.

In order to map measurement frameworks into data needs, it is helpful to
distinguish between two types of variables: variables that tie the research
design to observations in the data, which are called research design variables,
and variables that correspond to observations of the real world, which are
called measurement variables. Research design variables map information about
the research subjects onto the research design. Often, these variables have no
meaning outside of the research project—for example, identification variables
and treatment status. Others are observations from the real world, but only
those that determine how each specific research unit should be handled during
the analysis—for example, treatment uptake and eligibility status. Measurement
variables, in contrast, are real-world measures that are not determined by the
research team. Examples include characteristics of the research subject,
outcomes of interest, and control variables, among many others.


### Developing a data linkage table {-}

To create a data map according to the DIME template, the first step is to create
a data linkage table by listing in a spreadsheet all of the data sources that
will be used and the original data sets that will be created from them. If one
source of data will result in two different data sets, then each data set is
listed on its own row. For each data set, the unit of observation and the name
of the *project identifier*^[A **project identifier** (ID) is a research design
variable used consistently throughout a project to identify observations. For
each level of observation, the corresponding project ID variable must uniquely
and fully identify all observations in the project. For more details, see the
DIME Wiki at https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/ID_Variable_Properties.] (ID)
variable for that unit of observation are listed. It is important to include
both plain-language terminology as well as technical file and variable names
here. For example, the `hh_baseline2020_listmap.csv` data set may be titled the
“Baseline Household Listing” data; it may be identified by the `hh_id`
variable and listed as being identified at the household level. Establishing
such plain-language terminology early in the project allows the team to use
these labels unambiguously in communication.

The data linkage table is useful for planning how each unit of observation will
be identified in the data. When a data set is listed in the data linkage table,
which should be done before the data set is acquired, it is important to ensure
that the data will be fully and uniquely identified by the project ID or to plan
how the new data set will be linked to the project ID. Working with a data set
that does not have an unambiguous link to the project ID is very labor-intensive
and a major source of error (for an example of credible matching across data
sets in the absence of a unique ID, see @fernandes2017evaluation).

When combining data sets, the data linkage table should indicate whether data
sets can be merged one-to-one or appended (for example, with baseline and
endline data sets that use the same unit of observation) or whether two data
sets need to be merged many-to-one (for example, merging school administrative
data with student data). The data map must indicate which ID variables can be
used—and how—when combining data sets. The data linkage table is also a great
place to list other metadata, such as the source of the data, its backup
locations, the nature of the data license, and so on (see the example in
box 3.2).

::: {.ex}
#### BOX 3.2 DEVELOPING A DATA LINKAGE TABLE: AN EXAMPLE FROM THE DEMAND FOR SAFE SPACES PROJECT {-}

The main unit of observation in the platform survey data sets was the
respondent, uniquely identified by the variable `ID`. However, implicit
association tests (IATs) were collected through a specialized software that
produced output from two data sets for each IAT instrument: one at the
respondent level, containing the final scores, and one with detailed information
on each stimulus used in the test (images or expressions to be associated with
concepts). Three IAT instruments were used: one testing the association between
gender and career choice, one testing the association between car choice and
safety concerns, and one testing the association between car choice and openness
to sexual advances.

As a result, the original data for the platform survey component of the project
consisted of seven data sets: one for the platform survey and six for the
IAT—three with IAT scores (one for each instrument) and three with detailed
stimuli data (one for each instrument). All seven data sets were stored in the
same raw data folder. The data linkage table listed their filenames and
indicated how their ID variables are connected. In the table below, the raw
stimulus data do not have a unique identifier, because the same stimulus can be
shown repeatedly, so the “ID var” field is blank for these data sets.

| Data source	| Raw dataset name | Unit of observation <br> (ID var) |	Parent unit <br> (ID var) |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Platform survey	| platform_survey_raw_deidentified.dta	| respondent (id)	 | |
| Gender-career implicit association test	| career_stimuli.dta	| stimulus	| respondent (id) question block (block) |
| Car choice-safety concerns implicit association test	| security_stimuli.dta	| stimulus	| respondent (id) question block (block)|
| Car choice-openness to advances implicit association test	| reputation_stimuli.dta |	stimulus	| respondent (id) question block (block) |

| Car choice-openness to advances implicit association test |	reputation_score.dta	| respondent (id)	 ||

### Constructing master data sets {-}

The second step in creating a data map is to create one master data set for each
unit of observation that will be used in any research activity. Examples of such
activities are data collection, data analysis, sampling, and treatment
assignment. The master data set is the authoritative source of the project ID
and all research design variables for the corresponding unit of observation,
such as sample status and treatment assignment. Therefore, the master data set
serves as an unambiguous method of mapping the observations in the data to the
research design. A master data set should not include any measurement variables.
Research design variables and measurement variables may come from the same
source, but should not be stored in the same way. For example, if the project
acquires administrative data that include both information on eligibility for
the study (research design variables) and data on the topic of study
(measurement variables), the research design variables should be stored in the
master data set, and the measurement variables should be stored separately and
prepared for analysis as described in chapter 5.

Each master data set is to be the authoritative source for how all observations
at that unit of analysis are identified. Therefore, the master data sets should
include identifying information such as names, contact information, and project
ID. The project ID is the ID variable used in the data linkage table and is
therefore used to link observations across data sets. The master data set may
list alternative IDs—for example, IDs used by a partner organization—but an
alternative ID should never be used as the project ID, because doing so would
allow individuals outside the research team to identify the research subjects.
The project team must create the project ID, and the linkage to direct
identifiers should be accessible only to people listed on the protocol approved
by the institutional review board. The master data set serves as the link
between all other identifying information and the project ID. Because the master
data set is full of directly identifying information, it must always be
encrypted. If a data set is received with an alternative ID, it should be
replaced with the project ID as a part of the de-identification process (see
chapters 5 and 7 for more on de-identification). The alternative ID should be
stored in the master data set so that it may be linked back to the data using
the project ID if needed. Any data set that needs to retain an alternative ID
for any reason should be treated as confidential data; it should always be
encrypted and never published.

The starting point for the master data set is typically a sampling frame (more
on sampling frames later in this chapter). However, it is essential to update
the master data set continuously with all observations encountered in the
project, even if those observations are not eligible for the study. Examples
include new observations that are listed during monitoring activities or
observations that are connected to respondents in the study—for example, in a
social network module. This updating is useful because errors become less likely
in record linkages such as fuzzy matching using string variables as more
information is added to the master data set. If it is ever necessary to perform
a fuzzy match to a data source that does not have a unique ID, this task should
be done using the master data set (for an example, see @benhassine2018does).
Data from sources that are not fully and uniquely identified with the project ID
should not be cleaned or analyzed until the project IDs have been merged
successfully from the master data set. If this process results in the project
adding new observations to the master data set, it is necessary to confirm
beyond a reasonable doubt that the new observation is indeed a new observation
and not simply a failed match to an observation already contained in the master
data set. For example, it should be checked whether identifiers such as proper
names have inconsistent spellings or romanizations or whether identifiers such
as addresses or phone numbers have become outdated.

### Creating data flowcharts {-}

The third and final step in creating the data map is to create data flowcharts.
Each analysis data set (see chapter 6 for a discussion on why multiple analysis
data sets may be needed) should have a data flowchart showing how it was
created. The flowchart is a diagram in which each starting point is either a
master data set or a data set listed in the data linkage table. The data
flowchart should include instructions on how the original data sets can be
combined to create the analysis data set. The operations used to combine the
data could include appending, one-to-one merging, many-to-one or one-to-many
merging, collapsing, reshaping, or a broad variety of other operations. It is
important to list which variable or set of variables should be used in each
operation and to note whether the operation creates a new variable or a
combination of variables to identify the newly linked data. Data sets should be
linked by project IDs when possible (exceptions are time variables in
longitudinal data and subunits like farm plots, which correspond to a farmer
with a project ID but do not themselves have project IDs). Once the data sets
listed in the flowchart have been acquired, the number of observations that the
starting point data set has and the number of observations that each resulting
data set should have after each operation can be added to the data flowcharts.
This method is useful for tracking attrition and making sure that the operations
used to combine data sets do not create unwanted duplicates or incorrectly drop
any observations.

The information that goes into the data flowcharts can be expressed in text, but
diagrams generally are the most efficient way to communicate this information
across a team (see the example in box 3.3). A data flowchart can be created
using a flowchart drawing tool (many free options are available online) or using
the shapes or tools in Microsoft Office. It can also be created simply by
drawing on a piece of paper and taking a photo, but a digital tool is
recommended so that flowcharts can be updated easily over time if needed. As
with the data linkage table, the flowchart should include both technical
information and plain-language interpretations of the operations that are done
and the data that are created. This information is useful for understanding the
complex data combinations that often result from merges and appends, such as
panel data sets like “person-year” structures and multilevel data like
“district-school-teacher-student” structures.

The flowchart summarizes each operation that changes the level of observation of
the data and how data sets will be combined. Because these changes are the most
error-prone data-processing tasks, having a high-level plan for how they will be
executed helps to clarify the process for everyone on the data team, preventing
future mistakes.

combined to create a final respondent-level data set that was used for analysis.

## Translating research design to data needs {-}

An important step in translating the research design into a specific data
structure is to determine which research design variables are needed to infer
which differences in measurement variables are attributable to the research
design. These data needs should be expressed in the data map by listing the data
source for each variable in the data linkage table, by adding columns for them
in the master data set (the master data set might not have any observations yet;
that is not a problem), and by indicating in the data flowcharts how they will
be merged with the analysis data. It is important to perform this task before
acquiring any data, to make sure that the data acquisition activities described
in chapter 4 will generate the data needed to answer the research questions.

Because DIME works primarily on impact evaluations, the discussion here focuses
on research designs that compare a group that received some kind of
*treatment*^[A **treatment** is an evaluated intervention or event, which
includes things like being offered training or a cash transfer from a program or
experiencing a natural disaster, among many others.] against a
*counterfactual*^[A **counterfactual** is a statistical description of what
would have happened to specific individuals in an alternative scenario—for
example, a different treatment assignment outcome.]. The key assumption is that
each person, facility, or village (or whatever the unit of analysis is) has two
possible states: the outcome if the unit did receive the treatment and the
outcome if it did not receive the treatment. The *average treatment effect*^[An
**average treatment effect** (ATE) is the expected difference in a given outcome
between a unit observed in its treated state and the same unit observed in its
untreated state for a given treatment.] (ATE) is the difference between these
two states averaged over all units.

However, it is impossible to observe the same unit in both the treated and
untreated state simultaneously, so it is impossible to calculate these
differences directly. Instead, the treatment group is compared to a control
group that is statistically indistinguishable, which is often referred to as
achieving *balance* between two or more groups. DIME Analytics maintains a Stata
command to standardize and automate the creation of well-formatted balance
tables: `iebaltab` (for instructions and details, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/iebaltab>). Each research design has a different
method for identifying and balancing the counterfactual group. The rest of this
section covers how different methods require different research data. What does
not differ, however, is that these data requirements are all research design
variables that should always be included in the master data set. It is usually
necessary to merge the research design variables with other data sets many times
during a project, but this task is easy if the project has created a data
linkage table.

This chapter assumes that the reader has a working familiarity with the research
designs mentioned here. Appendix C provides more details and specific references
for common types of impact evaluation designs.

### Applying common research designs to data {-}

When using *experimental methods*^[**Experimental methods** are research
designs in which the researcher explicitly and intentionally induces variation
in an intervention assignment to facilitate causal inference. For more details,
see appendix C or the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Experimental_Methods.], such as *randomized
control trials*^[**Randomized control trials** (RCTs) are experimental design
methods of impact evaluation in which eligible units in a sample are randomly
assigned to treatment and control groups. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Randomized_Control_Trials.] (RCTs), the
research team determines which members of the studied population will receive
the treatment. This decision is typically made by a randomized process in which
a subset of the eligible population is randomly assigned to receive the
treatment (implementation is discussed later in this chapter). The intuition is
that, if everyone in the eligible population is assigned at random to either the
treatment or the control group, the two groups will, on average, be
statistically indistinguishable. Randomization makes it generally possible to
obtain unbiased estimates of the effects that can be attributed to a specific
program or ­intervention: in a randomized trial, the expected spurious
correlation between treatment and outcomes will approach zero as the sample size
increases (@duflo2007using, @JPAL2020rct). The randomized assignment should be
done using data from the master data set, and the result should be saved back to
the master data set before being merged with other data sets.

*Quasi-experimental methods*^[**Quasi-experimental methods** are research
designs in which the researcher uses natural or existing variation in an
intervention assignment to facilitate causal inference. For more details, see
appendix C or the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Quasi-Experimental_Methods.], by contrast, are
based on events not controlled by the research team. Instead, they rely on
“experiments of nature,” in which natural variation in exposure to treatment
can be argued to approximate deliberate randomization. This natural variation
has to be measured, and the master data set has to document how the variation is
categorized as outcomes of a naturally randomized assignment. Unlike carefully
planned experimental designs, quasi-experimental designs typically require the
luck of having access to data collected at the right times and places to exploit
events that occurred in the past. Therefore, these methods often use either
secondary data, including administrative data, or other classes of routinely
collected information; and it is important for the data linkage table to
document how these data can be linked to the rest of the data in the project.

Regardless of the type of design, it is necessary to be very clear about which
of the data points observed or collected are research design variables. For
example, *regression discontinuity*^[**Regression discontinuity** (RD) designs
are causal inference approaches that use cut-offs by which units on both sides
are assumed to be statistically similar but only units on one side receive the
treatment. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Regression_Discontinuity.] (RD) designs exploit
sharp breaks or limits in policy designs (for an example, see @alix2019can). The
cutoff determinant—or running variable—should be saved in the master data set.
In *instrumental variables*^[**Instrumental variables** (IV) designs are causal
inference approaches that overcome endogeneity through the use of a valid
predictor of treatment variation, known as an instrument. For more details, see
the DIME Wiki at https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Instrumental_Variables.] (IV)
designs, the instruments influence the probability of treatment (for an example,
see @calderon2017opportunity). These research design variables should be
collected and stored in the master data set. Both the running variable in RD
designs and the instruments in IV designs are among the rare examples of
research design variables that may vary over time. In such cases, the research
design should clearly indicate ex ante the point in time when they will be
recorded, and this information should be clearly documented in the master data
set.

In *matching*^[**Matching** designs are causal inference approaches that use
characteristics in the data to identify units that are statistically similar.
For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Matching.] designs, statistically similar
observations are identified using strata, indexes, or propensity scores
unrelated to the topic of the study. Matching can be used to pair units that
already have or will receive the treatment to identify statistically similarly
control units. It can also be used to identify pairs or groups of statistically
similar units within which the research team randomizes who will be treated.
Like all research design variables, the matching results should be stored in the
master data set. This recording is best done by assigning a matching ID to each
group and creating a variable in the master data set with the matching ID to
which each unit belongs (for an example, see @prennushi2014women).

### Including multiple time periods {-}

The data map should also consider whether the project uses data from one time
period or several. A study that observes data in only one time period is called
a *cross-sectional study*. Observations over multiple time periods, referred to
as *longitudinal data*, can consist of either *repeated cross sections* or
*panel data*. In repeated cross sections, each successive round of data
collection uses a new sample of units from the treatment and control groups
(which may or may not overlap), whereas in a panel data study the same units are
tracked and observed in each round (for an example, see @kondylis2016female). If
each round of data collection is a separate activity, then each round should be
treated as a separate source of data and given its own row in the data linkage
table.

Data that are generated continuously or are acquired at frequent intervals can
be treated as a single data source. When data are acquired in discrete batches,
the data linkage table must document how the different rounds will be combined.
It is important to keep track of the *attrition rate* in panel data, which is
the share of intended observations not observed in each round of data
collection. The characteristics of units that are not possible to track are
often correlated with the outcome being studied (for an example, see
@bertrand2017contemporaneous). For example, poorer households may live in more
informal dwellings, patients with worse health conditions might not survive to
follow-up, and so on. If this is the case, then estimated treatment effects
might in reality only be an artifact of the remaining sample being a subset of
the original sample that were better or worse off from the beginning. A research
design variable in the master data set is needed to indicate attrition. A
balance check using that attrition variable can provide insights about whether
the lost observations are systematically different from the rest of the sample.

### Incorporating monitoring data {-}

For any study with an ex ante design, *monitoring data*^[**Monitoring data**
are the data collected to understand take-up and implementation fidelity. They
allow the research team to know if the field activities are consistent with the
intended research design. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Administrative_and_Monitoring_Data.] are very
important for understanding whether the research design corresponds to reality.
The most typical example is to make sure that, in an experimental design, the
treatment is implemented according to the treatment assignment. Treatment is
often implemented by partners, and field realities may be more complex than
foreseen during research design. Furthermore, field staff of the partner
organization might not be aware that they are implementing a research design.

In all impact evaluation research designs, fidelity to the design is important
to record as well (for an example, see @pradhan2013evaluating). For example, a
program intended for students who scored under 50 percent on a test might have
some cases in which the program was offered to someone who scored 51 percent on
the test and participated in the program or someone who scored 49 percent on the
test but declined to participate in the program. Differences between assignments
and realizations should also be recorded in the master data sets. Therefore, for
nearly all research designs, it is essential to acquire monitoring data to
indicate how well the realized treatment implementation in the field corresponds
to the intended treatment assignment.

Although monitoring data have traditionally been collected by someone in the
field, it is increasingly common for monitoring data to be collected remotely.
Some examples of remote monitoring include the use of local collaborators to
upload geotagged images for visible interventions (such as physical
infrastructure), the installation of sensors to broadcast measurements (such as
air pollution or water flow), the distribution of wearable devices to track
location or physical activity, or the application of image recognition to
satellite data. In-person monitoring activities are often preferred, but cost
and travel dangers, such as conflicts or disease outbreaks, make remote
monitoring innovations increasingly appealing. If cost alone is the constraint,
it is worthwhile to consider monitoring a subset of the implementation area in
person. The information collected may not be detailed enough to be used as a
control in the analysis, but it will provide a means to estimate the validity of
the research design assumptions.

Linking monitoring data to the rest of data in the project is often complex and
a major source of errors. Monitoring data are rarely received in the same format
or structure as research data (for an example, see @goldstein2015formalizing).
For example, the project may receive a list of the names of all people who
attended a training or administrative data from a partner organization without
any unique ID. In both of these cases, it can be difficult to ensure a
one-to-one match between units in the monitoring data and the master data sets.
Planning ahead and collaborating closely with the implementing organization from
the outset of the project are the best ways to avoid these difficulties. Often,
it is ideal for the research team to prepare forms (paper or electronic) for
monitoring, preloading them with the names of sampled individuals or ensuring
that a consistent ID is directly linkable to the project ID. If monitoring data
are not handled carefully and actively used in fieldwork, treatment
implementation may end up being poorly correlated with treatment assignment,
without a way to tell if the lack of correlation is a result of bad matching of
monitoring data or a meaningful problem of implementation.

## Creating research design variables by randomization {-}

*Random sampling* and *random treatment assignment* are two core research
activities that generate important research design variables. These processes
directly determine the set of units that will be observed and what their status
will be for the purpose of estimating treatment effects.
*Randomization*^[**Randomization** is the process of generating a sequence of
unrelated numbers, typically for the purpose of implementing a research design
that requires a key element to exhibit zero correlation with all other
variables. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Randomization.] is used to ensure that samples
are representative and that treatment groups are statistically
indistinguishable. Randomization is often used to produce random samples and
random treatment assignments. In this book, the term “randomization” is used
only to describe the process of generating a sequence of unrelated numbers, even
though it is often used in practice to refer to random treatment assignment.

Randomization in statistical software is nontrivial, and its mechanics are not
intuitive for the human mind. The principles of randomization apply not just to
random sampling and random assignment but also to all statistical computing
processes that have random components, such as simulations and bootstrapping.
Furthermore, all random processes introduce statistical noise or uncertainty
into the estimates of effect sizes. Choosing one random sample from all of the
possibilities produces some probability of choosing a group of units that are
not, in fact, representative. Similarly, choosing one random assignment produces
some probability of creating groups that are not good counterfactuals for each
other. *Power calculation* and *randomization inference* are the main methods by
which these probabilities of error are assessed. These analyses are particularly
important in the initial phases of development research—typically conducted
before any data acquisition or field work occur—and have implications for
feasibility, planning, and budgeting.

### Randomizing sampling and treatment assignment {-}

*Random sampling* is the process of randomly selecting observations from a list
of units to create a subsample that is representative or that has specific
statistical properties (such as selecting only from eligible units, oversampling
populations of interest, or other techniques such as weighted probabilities).
This process can be used, for example, to select a subset from all eligible
units to be included in data collection when the cost of collecting data on
everyone is prohibitive. For more details on sampling, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Sampling>. It can also be used to select a
subsample of observations to test a computationally heavy process before running
it on the full data.

*Randomized treatment assignment* is the process of assigning observations to
different treatment arms. This process is central to experimental research
design. Most of the code processes used for randomized assignment are the same
as those used for sampling, which also entails randomly splitting a list of
observations into groups. Whereas sampling determines whether a particular unit
will be observed at all in the course of data collection, randomized assignment
determines whether each unit will be observed in a treatment state or in a
counterfactual state.

The list of units to sample or assign from may be called a *sampling universe*,
a *listing frame*, or something similar. In almost all cases, the starting point
for randomized sampling or assignment should be a master data set, and the
result of the randomized process should always be saved in the master data set
before it is merged with any other data. The only exceptions are when the
sampling universe cannot be known in advance. For example, randomized assignment
cannot start from a master data set when sampling is done in real time, such as
randomly sampling patients as they arrive at a health facility or when treatment
is assigned through an in-person lottery. In those cases, it is important to
collect enough data during real-time sampling or to prepare the inputs for the
lottery such that all units can be added to the master data set afterward.

The simplest form of sampling is *uniform-probability random sampling*, which
means that every eligible observation in the master data set has an equal
probability of being selected. The most explicit method of implementing this
process is to assign random numbers to all of the potential observations, order
them by the number they are assigned, and mark as “sampled” those with the
lowest numbers, up to the desired proportion. It is important to become familiar
with exactly how the process works. The do-file in box 3.4 provides an example
of how to implement uniform-probability sampling in practice. The code there
uses a Stata built-in data set and is fully reproducible (more on reproducible
randomization in next section), so anyone who runs this code in any version of
Stata later than 13.1 (the version set in this code) will get the exact same,
but still random, results.

:::

Sampling typically has only two possible outcomes: observed and unobserved.
Similarly, a simple randomized assignment has two outcomes: treatment and
control; the logic in the code is identical to the sampling code example.
However, randomized assignment often involves multiple treatment arms, each
representing different varieties of treatment to be delivered (for an example,
see @de2013helping); in some cases, multiple treatment arms are intended to
overlap in the same sample. Randomized assignment can quickly grow in
complexity, and it is doubly important to understand fully the conceptual
process described in the experimental design and to fill in any gaps before
implementing it in code. The do-file in box 3.5 provides an example of how to
implement randomized assignment with multiple treatment arms.

### Programming reproducible random processes {-}

For statistical programming to be reproducible, it is necessary to be able to
reobtain its exact outputs in the future (@orozco2018make). This section focuses
on what is needed to produce truly random results and to ensure that those
results can be obtained again. This effort takes a combination of strict rules,
solid understanding, and careful programming. The rules are not negotiable (but
thankfully are simple). Stata, like most statistical software, uses a
*pseudo-random number generator*^[A **pseudo-random number generator** is an
algorithm that creates a long, fixed sequence of numbers in which no statistical
relationship exists between the position or value of any set of those
numbers.], which, in ordinary research use, produces sequences of numbers that
are as good as random. However, for *reproducible
randomization*^[**Reproducible randomization** is a random process that will
produce the same results each time it is executed. For more details on
reproducible randomization in Stata, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Randomization_in_Stata.], two additional
properties are needed: the ability to fix the sequence of numbers generated and
the a ­ bility to ensure that the first number is independently randomized. In
Stata, reproducible randomization is accomplished through three concepts:
versioning, sorting, and seeding. Stata is used in the examples, but the same
principles translate to all other programming languages.

  - *Rule 1: Versioning* requires using the same version of the software each
    time the random process is run. If anything is different, the underlying
    list of pseudo-random numbers may have changed, and it may be impossible to
    recover the original result. In Stata, the `version` command ensures that
    the list of numbers is fixed. Most important is to use the same version
    across a project, but, at the time of writing, using Stata version 13.1 is
    recommended for backward compatibility. The algorithm used to create this
    list of random numbers was changed after Stata 14, but the improvements are
    unlikely to matter in practice. The `ieboilstart`^[**ieboilstart** is a
    Stata command to standardize version, memory, and other Stata settings
    across all users for a project. It is part of the `ietoolkit` package. For
    more details, see the DIME Wiki at
    https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/ieboilstart.] command in `ietoolkit`
    provides functionality to support this requirement. Using `ieboilstart` at
    the beginning of the *master do-file*^[A **master script** (in Stata, a
    **master do-file**) is a single code script that can be used to execute all
    of the data work for a project, from importing the original data to
    exporting the final outputs. Any team member should be able to run this
    script and all the data work scripts executed by it by changing only the
    directory file path in one line of code in the master script. For more
    details, see the DIME Wiki at
    https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Master_Do-files.] is recommended. Testing
    the do-files without running them via the master do-file may produce
    different results, because Stata’s `version` setting expires after code
    execution completes.


  - *Rule 2: Sorting* requires using a fixed order of the actual data on which
    the random process is run. Because random numbers are assigned to each
    observation row by row starting from the top row, changing their order will
    change the result of the process. In Stata, using `isid [id_variable], sort`
    is recommended to guarantee a unique sorting order. This command does
    two things. First, it tests that all observations have unique values in the
    sorting variable, because duplicates would cause an ambiguous sort order. If
    all values are unique, then the command sorts on this variable, guaranteeing
    a unique sort order. It is a common misconception that the `sort, stable`
    command may also be used; however, by itself, this command cannot guarantee
    an unambiguous sort order and therefore is not appropriate for this purpose.
    Because the exact order must remain unchanged, the underlying data must
    remain unchanged between runs. If the number of observations is expected to
    change (for example, to increase during ongoing data collection),
    randomization will not be reproducible unless the data are split into
    smaller fixed data sets in which the number of observations does not change.
    Those smaller data sets can be combined after randomization.

  - *Rule 3: Seeding* requires manually setting the start point in the list of
    pseudo-random numbers. A seed is a single number that specifies one of the
    possible start points. It should be at least six digits long and contain
    exactly one unique, different, and randomly created seed for each
    randomization process. To create a seed that satisfies these conditions, see
    <https://bit.ly/stata-random>. (This link is a shortcut to a page of the
    website <https://www.random.org> where the best practice criteria for a seed
    are predefined.) In Stata, `set seed [seed]` will set the generator to the
    start point identified by the seed. In R, the `set.seed` function does the
    same. To be clear: setting a single seed once in the master do-file is not
    recommended; instead, a new seed should be set in code right before each
    random process. The most important task is to ensure that each of these
    seeds is truly random; shortcuts such as the current date or a previously
    used seed should not be used. Comments in the code should describe how the
    seed was selected.


How the code was run needs to be confirmed carefully before finalizing it,
because other commands may induce randomness in the data, change the sorting
order, or alter the place of the pseudo-random number generator. The process for
confirming that randomization has worked correctly before finalizing its results
is to save the outputs of the process in a temporary location, rerun the code,
and use the Stata commands `cf` or `datasignature` to ensure that nothing has
changed. It is also advisable to let someone else reproduce the randomization
results on another machine to remove any doubt that the results are
reproducible. Once the result of a randomization is used in the field, there is
no way to correct mistakes. The code in box 3.6 provides an example of a fully
reproducible randomization.

:::

As discussed previously, at times it may not be possible to use a master data
set for randomized sampling or treatment assignment (for example, when sampling
patients on arrival or through live lotteries). Methods like a real-time lottery
typically do not leave a record of the randomization and, as such, are never
reproducible. However, a reproducible randomization can be run in advance even
without an advance list of eligible units. For example, to select a subsample of
patients randomly as they arrive at various health facilities, it is possible to
compile a pregenerated list with a random order of “in sample” and “not in
sample.” Field staff would then go through this list in order and cross off one
randomized result as it is used for a patient.

This method is especially beneficial when implementing a more complex
randomization. For example, a hypothetical research design may call for
enumerators to undertake the following:

1.  Sample 10 percent of people observed in a particular location.
2.  Show a video to 50 percent of the sample.
3.  Administer a short questionnaire to 80 percent of all persons sampled.
4.  Administer a longer questionnaire to the remaining 20 percent, with the mix
    of questionnaires equal between those who were shown the video and those who
    were not.

In real time, such a complex randomization is much more likely to be implemented
correctly if field staff can simply follow a list of the randomized categories
for which the project team is in control of the predetermined proportions and
the random order. This approach makes it possible to control precisely how these
categories are distributed across all of the locations where the research is to
be conducted.

Finally, if this real-time implementation of randomization is done using survey
software, then the pregenerated list of randomized categories can be preloaded
into the questionnaire. Then the field team can follow a list of respondent IDs
that are randomized into the appropriate categories, and the survey software can
show a video and control which version of the questionnaire is asked. This
approach can help to reduce the risk of errors in field randomization.

### Implementing clustered or stratified designs {-}

For a variety of reasons, random sampling and random treatment assignment are
rarely as straightforward as a uniform-probability draw. The most common
variants are clustering and stratification (@athey2017econometrics).
*Clustering*^[**Clustering** is a research design in which the unit of
randomization or unit of sampling differs from the unit of analysis. For more
details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Clustered_Sampling_and_Treatment_Assignment.]
occurs when the unit of analysis is different from the unit of randomization in
a research design. For example, a policy may be implemented at the village level
or the project may only be able to send enumerators to a limited number of
villages, but the outcomes of interest for the study are measured at the
household level. In such cases, the higher-level groupings by which lower-level
units are randomized are called *clusters* (for an example, see
@keating2011evaluating).

*Stratification*^[**Stratification** is a statistical technique that ensures
that subgroups of the population are represented in the sample and treatment
groups. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Stratified_Random_Sample.] splits the full set
of observations into subgroups, or strata, before performing randomized
assignment within each subgroup, or stratum. Stratification ensures that members
of each stratum are included in all groups of the randomized assignment process
or that members of all groups are observed in the sample. Without
stratification, randomization may put all members of a given subgroup into just
one of the treatment arms or fail to select any of them into a sample. For both
clustering and stratification, implementation is nearly identical in both random
sampling and random assignment.

*Clustered randomization* is procedurally straightforward in Stata, although it
typically needs to be performed manually. The process for clustering a sampling
or randomized assignment is to randomize on the master data set for the unit of
observation of the cluster and then merge the results with the master data set
for the unit of analysis. This is a many-to-one merge, and the data map should
document how those data sets can be merged correctly. If the project does not
yet have a master data set for the unit of observation of the cluster, then it
is necessary to create one and update the data map accordingly. When sampling or
randomized assignment is conducted using clusters, the cluster ID variable
should be clearly identified in the master data set for the unit of analysis
because it will need to be used in subsequent statistical analysis. Typically,
standard errors for clustered designs must be clustered at the level at which
the design is clustered (McKenzie 2017). This clustering accounts for the design
covariance within the clusters—the information that, if one unit is observed or
treated from that cluster, the other members of the cluster are as well.

Although procedurally straightforward, implementing stratified designs in
statistical software is prone to error. Even for a relatively simple
multiple-arm design, the basic method of randomly ordering the observations will
often create very skewed assignments in the presence of strata (McKenzie 2011).
The user-written `randtreat` Stata command properly implements stratification
(@carril2017dealing). The options and outputs (including messages) from the
command should be reviewed carefully so that it is clear exactly what has been
implemented—`randtreat` performs a two-step process in which it takes the
straightforward approach as far as possible and then, according to the user’s
instructions, handles the remaining observations in a consistent fashion.
Notably, it is extremely hard to target exact numbers of observations in
stratified designs because exact allocations are rarely round fractions.



### Performing power calculations {-}

Random sampling and treatment assignment are noisy processes: it is impossible
to predict the result in advance. By design, the exact choice of sample or
treatment will not be correlated with the key outcomes, but this lack of
correlation is only true “in expectation”—that is, the correlation between
randomization and other variables will only be zero on average across a large
number of randomizations. In any particular randomization, the correlation
between the sampling or randomized assignments and the outcome variable is
guaranteed to be nonzero: this is called *in-sample* or *finite-sample correlation*.

Because the true correlation (over the “population” of potential samples or
assignments) is zero, the observed correlation is considered an error. In
sampling, this error is called the sampling error, and it is defined as the
difference between a true population parameter and the observed mean due to the
chance selection of units. In randomized assignment, this error is called
randomization noise and is defined as the difference between a true treatment
effect and the estimated effect due to the placement of units in treatment
groups. The intuition for both measures is that, from any group, it is possible
to find some subsets that have higher-than-average values of some measure and
some that have lower-than-average values. The random sample or treatment
assignment will fall into one of these categories, and it is necessary to assess
the likelihood and magnitude of this occurrence. Power calculation and
randomization inference are the two key tools for doing so.

*Power calculations* report the likelihood that the experimental design will be
able to detect the treatment effects of interest given these sources of noise.
This measure of power can be described in various ways, each of which has
different practical uses. The purpose of power calculations is to identify where
the strengths and weaknesses are located and to understand the relative
trade-offs that the project will face if the randomization scheme is changed for
the final design. It is important to consider take-up rates and attrition when
doing power calculations. Incomplete take-up will significantly reduce power,
and understanding what minimum level of take-up is required can help to guide
field operations (for this reason, monitoring take-up in real time is often
critical).

The *minimum detectable effect*^[The **minimum detectable effect** (MDE) is the
effect size that an impact evaluation is able to estimate for a given level of
significance. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Minimum_Detectable_Effect.] (MDE) is the
smallest true effect that a given research design can reliably detect. It is
useful as a check on whether a study is worthwhile. If, in a field of study, a
“large” effect is just a few percentage points or a small fraction of a
standard deviation, then it is nonsensical to run a study whose MDE is much
larger than that. Given the sample size and variation in the population, the
effect needs to be much larger to be statistically detected, so such a study
would never be able to say anything about the size of effect that is practically
relevant. Conversely, the *minimum sample size* prespecifies expected effect
sizes and indicates how large a study’s sample would need to be to detect that
effect, which can determine what resources are needed to implement a useful
study.

*Randomization inference*^[**Randomization inference** is a method of
calculating regression p-values that takes into account variability in data that
arises from randomization itself. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Randomization_Inference.] is used to analyze
the likelihood that the randomized assignment process, by chance, would have
created a false treatment effect as large as the one estimated. Randomization
inference is a generalization of placebo tests, because it considers what the
estimated results would have been from a randomized assignment that did not
happen in reality. Randomization inference is particularly important in
quasi-experimental designs and in small samples, in which the number of possible
randomizations is itself small. Randomization inference can therefore be used
proactively during experimental design to examine the potential spurious
treatment effects the exact design is able to produce. If results heap
significantly at particular levels or if results seem to depend dramatically on
the outcome of randomization for a small number of units, randomization
inference will flag those issues before the study is fielded and allow
adjustments to the design.

## Looking ahead {-}

This chapter introduced the DIME data map template, a toolkit to document a data
acquisition plan and to describe how each data source relates to the design of a
study. The data map contains research design variables and the instructions for
using them in combination with measurement variables, which together form the
data set(s) for the analytical work. It then discussed ways to use this planning
data to inform and execute research design tasks, such as randomized sampling
and assignment, and to produce concrete measures of whether the project design
is sufficient to answer the research questions posed. The next chapter turns to
data acquisition—the first step toward answering those questions. It details the
processes of obtaining original data, whether those data are collected by the
project or received from another entity.
