# Acquiring development data {#acquisition}

Many research questions require original data because no source of publicly
available data addresses the inputs or outcomes of interest for the relevant
population. Data acquisition can take many forms, including primary data
generated through surveys; private sector partnerships granting access to new
data sources, such as administrative and sensor data; digitization of paper
records, including administrative data; web scraping; data captured by unmanned
aerial vehicles or other types of remote sensing; and novel integration of
various types of data sets, such as combining survey and sensor data. Much of
the recent push toward credibility in the social sciences has focused on
analytical practices. However, credible development research depends, first and
foremost, on the quality of the data acquired. Clear and careful documentation
of the data acquisition process is essential for research to be reproducible.

This chapter covers reproducible data acquisition, special considerations for
generating high-quality survey data, and protocols for handling confidential
data safely and securely. The first section discusses acquiring data
reproducibly, by establishing and documenting the right to use the data. This
discussion applies to all original data, whether collected for the first time
through surveys or sensors or acquired through a unique partnership. The second
section examines the process of acquiring data through surveys, which is
typically more involved than acquiring secondary data and has more in-built
opportunities for quality control. It provides detailed guidance on the
electronic survey workflow, from designing electronic survey instruments to
monitoring data quality once fieldwork is ongoing. The final section discusses
handling data safely, providing guidance on how to receive, transfer, store, and
share confidential data. Secure file management is a basic requirement for
complying with the legal and ethical agreements that allow access to personal
information for research purposes. Box 4.1 summarizes the main points, lists the
responsibilities of different members of the research team, and supplies a list
of key tools and resources for implementing the recommended practices.

#### BOX 4.1 SUMMARY: ACQUIRING DEVELOPMENT DATA {-}

The process of obtaining research data is unique to every project. However, some
basic structures and processes are common to both data acquired from others and
data generated by surveys:

1.  *When receiving data from others, ownership and licensing are critical.*
    Before any data are transferred, knowing all of the formal rights associated
    with those data is essential:

  - Ensure that the partner has the right to share the data, especially data
    containing personally identifying information.
  - Identify the data owner and any restrictions on the use, storage, or
    handling of data.
  - Secure a data use agreement or license from the partner, outlining the
    rights and responsibilities regarding analysis, publication of results and
    derived data, redistribution of data, and data destruction.

2.  *Collecting high-quality data requires careful planning and attention to
    detail throughout the workflow.* The following best practices apply to all
    surveys, with further details for electronic surveys:

  - Produce and pilot draft instruments on paper and focus on survey content.
  - Structure questionnaires for electronic programming and pilot them for
    function, considering features like pagination, ordering, looping,
    conditional execution, and instructions for enumerators.
  - Test data outputs for analytical compatibility, such as code-friendly
    variable and value labels.
  - Train enumerators carefully, using a paper survey before an electronic
    template, assess their performance objectively throughout training, and
    transparently select the top performers.
  - Assess data quality in real time, through scripted high-frequency checks and
    diligent field validation.

3.  *No matter how data are acquired, handling data securely is essential:*

  - Encrypt data on all devices, in transit and at rest, beginning from the
    point of collection and including all intermediate locations such as servers
    and local devices.
  - Store encryption keys using appropriate password management software with
    strong, unique passwords for all applications and devices with access.
  - Back up data in case of total loss or failure of hardware and software at
    any site.

#### Key responsibilities for task team leaders and principal investigators {-}

  - Obtain appropriate legal documentation and permission agreements for all
    data.
  - For surveys, guide and supervise development of all instruments.
  - For surveys, review and provide inputs to the project’s data quality
    assurance plan.
  - For surveys, guide decisions on how to correct issues identified during data
    quality checks.
  - Oversee implementation of security measures and manage access codes,
    encryption keys, and hardware.
  - Determine and communicate institutionally appropriate data storage and
    backup plans.

#### Key responsibilities for research assistants {-}

  - Coordinate with data providers, develop required technical documentation,
    and archive all final documentation.
  - For surveys, draft, refine, and program all survey instruments, following
    best practices for electronic survey programming and maintaining up-to-date
    and version-controlled paper and electronic versions.
  - For surveys, coordinate closely with field staff on survey pilots and
    contribute to enumerator manuals.
  - For surveys, draft a data quality assurance plan and manage the quality
    assurance process.
  - Implement storage and security measures for all data.

## Acquiring data ethically and reproducibly {-}

Clearly establishing and documenting access to data are critical for
reproducible research. This section provides guidelines for establishing data
ownership, receiving data from development partners, and documenting the
research team’s right to use data. Researchers are responsible not only for
respecting the rights of both people who own and people who are described by the
data but also for making that information as available and as accessible as
possible. These twin responsibilities can and do come into tension, so it is
important for everyone on the team to be informed about what everyone else is
doing. Writing down and agreeing to specific details is a good way to do that.

### Determining data ownership {-}

Before acquiring any data, it is critical to establish *data ownership*^[**Data
ownership** is the assignment of rights and privileges over data sets, including
control over who may access, possess, copy, use, distribute, or publish data or
products created from the data. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Ownership.]. Data ownership can sometimes
be challenging to establish, because different jurisdictions have different laws
regarding data and information, and the research team may have its own
regulations. In some jurisdictions, data are implicitly owned by the people to
whom the information pertains. In others, data are owned by the people who
collect the information. In still others, ownership is highly unclear, and there
are varying norms. The best approach is always to consult with a local partner
and to enter into specific legal agreements establishing ownership, access, and
publication rights. These agreements are particularly critical when confidential
data are involved—that is, when people are disclosing information that could not
be obtained simply by observation or through public records.

If the research team is requesting access to existing data, it must enter into
data license agreements to access the data and publish research outputs based on
the information. These agreements should make clear from the outset whether and
how the research team can make the original data public or whether it can
publish any portion or *derivatives*^[**Derivatives** of data are new data
points, new data sets, or outputs such as indicators, aggregates,
visualizations, and other research products created from the original data.] of
the data. If the data are publicly accessible, these agreements may be as simple
as agreeing to terms of use on the website from which the data can be
downloaded. If the data are original and not yet publicly accessible, the
process is typically more complex and requires a documented legal agreement or
memorandum of understanding.

If the research team is generating data directly, such as survey data, it is
important to clarify up front who owns the data and who will have access to the
information (see box 4.2 for an example of how data ownership considerations
may vary within a project). These details need to be shared with respondents
when they are offered the opportunity to consent to participate in the study. If
the research team is not collecting the data directly—for example, if a
government, private company, or research partner is collecting the data—an
explicit agreement is needed establishing who owns the resulting data.


::: {.ex}
#### BOX 4.2 DETERMINING DATA OWNERSHIP: A CASE STUDY FROM THE DEMAND FOR SAFE SPACES PROJECT {-}

The Demand for Safe Spaces study used three data sources, all of which had
different data ownership considerations.

1.  *Crowdsourced ride data from the mobile app.* The research team acquired
    crowdsourced data through a contract with the technology firm responsible
    for developing and deploying the application. The terms of the contract
    specified that all intellectual property in derivative works developed using
    the data set are the property of the World Bank.
2.  *Platform survey and implicit association test data.* A small team of
    consultants collected original data using a survey instrument developed by
    the research team. The contract specified that the data collected by the
    consultants and all derivative works are the sole intellectual property of
    the World Bank.
3.  *Crime data.* The team also used one variable (indicating crime rate at the
    Supervia stations) from publicly accessible data produced by Rio’s Public
    Security Institute. The data are published under Brazil’s Access to
    Information Law and are available for download from the institute’s website.

:::

The contract for data collection should include specific terms as to the rights
and responsibilities of each stakeholder. It must clearly stipulate which party
owns the data produced and that the research team maintains full intellectual
property rights. The contract should also explicitly indicate that the
contracted firm is responsible for protecting the privacy of respondents, that
the data collection will not be delegated to any third parties, and that the
data will not be used by the firm or subcontractors for any purpose not
expressly stated in the contract, before, during, or after the assignment. The
contract should also stipulate that the vendor is required to comply with
ethical standards for social science research and to adhere to the specific
terms of agreement with the relevant *institutional review board*^[An
**institutional review board** (IRB) is an institutional body formally
responsible for ensuring that research under its oversight meets minimum ethical
standards. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/IRB_Approval.] (IRB) or applicable local
authority. Finally, it should include policies on the reuse, storage, and
retention or destruction of data.

Research teams that acquire original data must also consider data ownership
downstream, through the terms they use to release those data to other
researchers or to the general public. The team should consider whether it can
publish the data in full after removing personal identifiers. For example, the
team must consider whether it would be acceptable for the data to be copied and
stored on servers anywhere in the world, whether it would be preferable to
manage permissions on a case-by-case basis, and whether data users would be
expected to cite or credit them. Similarly, the team can require users to
release the derivative data sets or publications under similar licenses or offer
use without restriction. Simple license templates are available for offering
many of these permissions, but, at the planning stage, all licensing agreements,
data collection contracts, and informed consent processes used to acquire the
data need to detail those future uses specifically.

### Obtaining data licenses {-}

*Data licensing*^[**Data licensing** is the process of formally granting rights
and privileges over data sets to people who are not the owner of the data. For
more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_License_Agreement.] is the formal act
of the owner giving some rights to a specific user, while retaining ownership of
the data set. If the team does not own the data set to be analyzed, it must
enter into a licensing agreement to access the data for research purposes.
Similarly, if the team does own a data set, it must consider whether the data
set will be made accessible to other researchers and what terms of use will be
required.

If the research team requires access to existing data for novel research, it is
necessary to agree on the terms of use with the data owner, typically through a
data license agreement. These terms should specify what data elements will be
received, the purposes for which the data will be used, and who will have access
to the data. The data owner is unlikely to be highly familiar with the research
process and may be surprised at some of the uses to which the data could be put.
It is essential to be forthcoming about the uses up front. Researchers typically
want to hold intellectual property rights to all research outputs developed with
the data and a license for all uses of derivative works, including public
distribution (unless ethical considerations contraindicate this right). Holding
these rights allows the research team to store, catalog, and publish, in whole
or in part, either the original licensed data set or data sets derived from the
original. It is important to ensure that the license obtained from the data
owner allows these uses and that the owner is consulted if exceptions for
specific portions of the data are foreseen.

The Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) department follows the World Bank’s
template data license agreement. The template specifies the specific objectives
of the data sharing and whether the data can be used for the established purpose
only or for other objectives as well. It classifies data into one of four access
categories, depending on who can access the data by default and whether
case-by-case authorization for access is needed. The data provider may impose
similar restrictions on sharing derivative data and any or all of the associated
metadata. The template also specifies the required citation for the data.
Although it is not necessary to use the World Bank’s template or its access
categories if the team is not working on a World Bank project, the information
in the template is useful in two ways. First, it is necessary to base the data
license agreement on a template. Ad hoc agreements can leave many legal
ambiguities or gaps where the permissions given to the research team are unclear
or incomplete. Second, it is strongly recommended that the data be categorized
using some variation of this system. Doing so will create different standard
procedures for each category, so that the intended processes for handling the
data are clear.

### Documenting data received from partners {-}

Research teams granted access to existing data may receive those data in several
ways: access to an existing server, physical access to extract certain
information, or a one-time data transfer. In all cases, action is required to
ensure that data are transferred through secure channels so that confidentiality
is not compromised. The section on handling data securely explains how to do
that. Compliance with ethical research standards may in some cases require a
stricter level of security than initially proposed by the partner agency. It is
also critical to request any and all available documentation for the data; this
documentation could take the form of a data dictionary or codebook, a manual for
the administrative data collection system, detailed reports or operating
procedures, or another format. If no written documentation is available, the
person(s) responsible for managing the data should be interviewed to learn as
much as possible about the data; the interview notes should be archived with
data documentation.

At this stage, it is very important to assess the documentation and cataloging
of data and associated metadata. It is not always clear what pieces of
information will jointly constitute a research data set, and many data sets are
not organized for research. The original data should be retained exactly as
received, alongside a copy of the corresponding ownership agreement or license.
A simple `README` document is needed, noting the date of receipt, the source and
recipient of the data, and a brief description of each file received. All too
often data are provided in vaguely named spreadsheets or digital files with
nonspecific titles. Documentation is critical for future access and
reproducibility.

Eventually, a set of documents will be created that can be submitted to a data
catalog and given a reference and citation. *Metadata*— documentation about the
data—are critical for future use of the data. Metadata should include
documentation of how the data were created, what they measure, and how they are
to be used. For survey data, this documentation should include the survey
instrument and associated manuals; the sampling protocols and field adherence to
those protocols and any sampling weights; what variable(s) uniquely identifies
the data set(s) and how different data sets can be linked; and a description of
field procedures and quality controls. DIME uses the Data Documentation
Initiative (DDI), which is supported by the World Bank’s Microdata Catalog
(<https://microdata.worldbank.org>).

As soon as the desired pieces of information are stored together, it is time to
think about which ones are the components of what will be called a data set.
Often, when receiving data from a partner, even highly structured materials such
as registers or records are not, as received, equivalent to a research data set;
they require initial cleaning, restructuring, or recombination to be considered
an original research data set. This process is as much an art as a science: it
is important to keep information together that is best contextualized together,
but information also needs to be as granular as possible, particularly when
there are varying units of observation. There is often no single correct way to
structure a data set, and the research team will need to decide how to organize
the materials received. Soon, research data sets will be built from this set of
information and become the original clean data, which will be the material
published, released, and cited as the starting point of the data. (If funders or
publishers request that “raw” data be published or cataloged, for example, they
should receive this data set, unless they specifically require data in the
original format received.) These first data sets created from the received
materials need to be cataloged, licensed, and prepared for release. This is a
good time to begin assessing the *disclosure risk*^[Statistical **disclosure
risk** is the likelihood of revealing information that can be used to associate
data points with individual research participants, especially through indirect
identifiers. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/De-identification.] and to seek publication
licenses in collaboration with data providers, while still in close contact with
them.

## Collecting high-quality data using electronic surveys {-}

This section details specific considerations for acquiring high-quality data
through electronic surveys of study subjects. If the project will not use any
survey data, skip this section. Many excellent resources address how to design
questionnaires and field supervision, but few cover the particular challenges
and opportunities presented by electronic surveys. Many survey software options
are available to researchers, and the market is evolving rapidly. Therefore,
this section focuses on specific workflow considerations for digitally collected
data and on basic concepts rather than on software-specific tools.

Electronic data collection technologies have greatly accelerated the ability to
collect high-quality data using purpose-built survey instruments and therefore
have improved the precision of research. At the same time, electronic surveys
create new pitfalls to avoid. Programming electronic surveys efficiently
requires a very different mindset than writing paper-based surveys; careful
preparation can improve the efficiency and data quality of surveys. This section
outlines the major steps and technical considerations to follow when fielding a
custom survey instrument, no matter the scale.

### Designing survey instruments {-}

A well-designed questionnaire results from careful planning, consideration of
analysis and indicators, close review of existing questionnaires, survey pilots,
and research team and stakeholder review. Many excellent resources discuss
*questionnaire design*^[**Questionnaire design** is the process of creating a
survey instrument, typically for data collection with human subjects. For
details and best practices, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Questionnaire_Design.], such as that of the
World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Survey (@glewwe2000designing). This
section focuses on the design of electronic field surveys, often referred to as
*computer-assisted personal interviews*^[**Computer-assisted personal
interviews** (CAPIs) are interviews that use a survey instrument programmed on a
tablet, computer, or mobile phone using specialized survey software. For more
details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Computer-Assisted_Personal_Interviews_(CAPI).
For CAPI questionnaire programming resources, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Questionnaire_Programming.] (CAPIs). Although
most surveys are now collected electronically, by tablet, mobile phone, or web
browser, questionnaire design (content development) and questionnaire
programming (functionality development) should be seen as two strictly separate
tasks. Therefore, the research team should agree on the content of all
questionnaires and design a version of the survey on paper before beginning to
program the electronic version. Doing so facilitates a focus on content during
the design process and ensures that teams have a readable, printable version of
the questionnaire. Most important, it means that the research, not the
technology, drives the questionnaire’s design.

This approach is recommended for three reasons. First, an easy-to-read paper
questionnaire is very useful for training data collection staff, which is
discussed further in the section on training enumerators. Second, finalizing the
paper version of the questionnaire before beginning any programming avoids
version-control concerns that arise from concurrent work on paper and electronic
survey instruments. Third, a readable paper questionnaire is a necessary
component of data documentation, because it is difficult to work backward from
the survey program to the intended concepts.

The workflow for designing a questionnaire is much like writing an essay: it
begins from broad concepts and slowly fleshes out the specifics. It is essential
to start with a clear understanding of the *theory of change*^[A **theory of
change** is a theoretical structure for conceptualizing how interventions or
changes in environment might affect behavior or outcomes, including intermediate
concepts, impacts, and processes. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Theory_of_Change.] and *research
design*^[**Research design** is the process of planning a scientific study so
that data can be generated, collected, and used to estimate specific parameters
accurately in the population of interest. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Experimental_Methods and
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Quasi-Experimental_Methods.] of the project.
The first step of questionnaire design is to list key outcomes of interest, the
main covariates to control for, and any variables needed for the specific
research design. The ideal starting point for this process is a *preanalysis
plan*^[A **preanalysis plan** is a document containing extensive details about
a study’s analytical approach, which is archived or published using a
third-party repository in advance of data acquisition. For more details, see the
DIME Wiki at https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Preanalysis_Plan.].

The list of key outcomes is used to create an outline of questionnaire modules.
The modules are not numbered; instead, a short prefix is used, because numbers
quickly become outdated when modules are reordered. For each module, it is
necessary to determine if the module is applicable to the full sample or only to
specific respondents and whether or how often the module should be repeated. For
example, a module on maternal health applies only to households with a woman who
has children, a household income module should be answered by the person
responsible for household finances, and a module on agricultural production
might be repeated for each crop cultivated by the household. Each module should
then be expanded into specific indicators to observe in the field. To the
greatest extent possible, using questions from reputable survey instruments that
have already been fielded is recommended rather than creating questions from
scratch (for links to recommended questionnaire libraries, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Literature_Review_for_Questionnaire> ).
Questionnaires for impact evaluation must also include ways to document the
reasons for *attrition* and treatment *contamination*. These data components are
essential for completing CONSORT records, a standardized system for reporting
enrollment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and data analysis through the
phases of a randomized trial (@begg1996improving).


### Piloting survey instruments {-}

A *survey pilot*^[A **survey pilot** is intended to test the theoretical and
practical performance of an intended data collection instrument. For more
details on how to plan, prepare for, and implement a survey pilot, see the DIME
Wiki at https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Survey_Pilot.] is critical to finalize
survey design. The pilot must be done out-of-sample, but in a context as similar
as possible to the study sample. The survey pilot includes three steps: a
prepilot, a content-focused pilot, and a data-focused pilot (see box 4.3 for a
description of the pilots for the Demand for Safe Spaces project).

The first step is a *prepilot*. The prepilot is a qualitative exercise, done
early in the questionnaire design process. The objective is to answer broad
questions about how to measure key outcome variables and gather qualitative
information relevant to any of the planned survey modules. A prepilot is
particularly important when designing new survey instruments.

The second step is a *content-focused pilot*. The objectives at this stage are
to improve the structure and length of the questionnaire, refine the phrasing
and translation of specific questions, check for potential sensitivities and
enumerator-respondent interactions, and confirm that coded-response options are
exhaustive. In addition, it provides an opportunity to test and refine all of
the survey protocols, such as how units will be sampled or preselected units
identified. The content-focused pilot is best done with pen and paper, before
the questionnaire is programmed, because changes resulting from this pilot may
be deep and structural, making them hard to adjust in code. At this point, it is
important to test both the validity and the reliability of the survey questions,
which requires conducting the content-focused pilot with a sufficiently large
sample (the exact requirement will depend on the research sample, but a very
rough rule of thumb is a minimum of 30 interviews). For a checklist for how to
prepare for a survey pilot, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Checklist:_Preparing_for_a_Survey_Pilot>. The
sample for the pilot should be as similar as possible to the sample for the full
survey, but the two should never overlap. For details on selecting appropriate
pilot respondents, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Survey_Pilot_Participants> . For checklists
detailing activities in a content-focused pilot, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Checklist:_Content-focused_Pilot> and
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Checklist:_Piloting_Survey_Protocols> .

The final stage is a *data-focused pilot*. After the content is finalized, it is
time to begin programming a draft version of the electronic survey instrument.
The objective of this pilot is to refine the programming of the questionnaire;
this process is discussed in detail in the following section.

::: {.ex}

#### BOX 4.3 PILOTING SURVEY INSTRUMENTS: A CASE STUDY FROM THE DEMAND FOR SAFE SPACES PROJECT  {-}

The context for the platform survey and implicit association test presented some
unique design challenges. The respondents to the survey were commuters on the
platform waiting to board the train. Given the survey setting, respondents might
need to leave at any time, so only a random subset of questions was asked to
each participant. The survey included a total of 25 questions on commuting
patterns, preferences about use of the reserved car, perceptions about safety,
and perceptions about gender issues and how they affect riding choices. While
waiting for their train, 1,000 metro riders answered the survey.
The team tested the questions extensively through pilots before commencing data
collection. On the basis of pilot data and feedback, questions that were causing
confusion were reworded, and the questionnaire was shortened to reduce
attrition. The research team designed a custom instrument to test for implicit
association between using or not using the women-reserved space and openness to
sexual advances. To determine the best words to capture social stigma, two
versions of the implicit association test instrument were tested, one with
“strong” and one with “weak” language (for example, "vulgar" vs. "seductive"),
and the response times were compared to other well-established instruments. For
the development of all protocols and sensitive survey questions, the research
team requested input and feedback from gender experts at the World Bank and
local researchers working on gender-related issues to ensure that the questions
were worded appropriately.

### Programming electronic survey instruments {-}

Once the team is satisfied with the content and structure of the survey, it is
time to move on to implementing it electronically. Electronic data collection
has great potential to simplify survey implementation and improve data quality.
But it is critical to ensure that electronic survey instruments flow correctly
and produce data that can be used in statistical software, before data
collection begins. Electronic questionnaires are typically developed in a
spreadsheet (usually using Excel or Google Sheets) or a software-specific form
builder, all of which are accessible even to novice users.

This book does not address software-specific design; rather, it focuses on
coding and design conventions that are important to follow for electronic
surveys regardless of the choice of software. (At the time of publication,
SurveyCTO is the most commonly used survey software in DIME. For best practices
for SurveyCTO code, which almost always apply to other survey software as well,
see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/SurveyCTO_Coding_Practices>.) Survey software
tools provide a wide range of features designed to make implementing even highly
complex surveys easy, scalable, and secure. However, these features are not
fully automatic: the survey must be designed and managed actively. This section
discusses specific practices that take advantage of electronic survey features
and ensure that the exported data are compatible with the statistical software
used.

From the perspective of quantitative analysis, questions with *coded-response
options*^[**Coded-response options** are responses to questions that require
respondents to select from a list of choices, corresponding to underlying
numerical response codes.] are always preferable to *open-ended
questions*^[**Open-ended questions** are responses to questions that do not
impose any structure on the response, typically recorded as free-flowing
text.]. The content-based pilot is an excellent time to ask open-ended
questions and refine fixed responses for the final version of the
questionnaire—it is rarely practical to code lots of free text after the full
survey has been conducted. Two examples help to illustrate this point. First,
instead of asking, "How do you feel about the proposed policy change?" use
techniques like *Likert scales*^[A **Likert scale** is an ordered selection of
choices indicating the respondent's level of agreement or disagreement with a
proposed statement.]. Second, if collecting data on things like medication use
or food supplies, collect, for example, the brand name of the product, the
generic name of the product, a coded identifier for the item, and the broad
category to which each product belongs (for example, "antibiotics" or "staple
foods") (for an example, see @wafula2017examining).

All four identifiers may be useful for different reasons, but the latter two are
likely to be the most useful for rapid data analysis. The coded identifiers
require providing field staff with a translation dictionary, but also enable
automated rapid recoding for analysis with no loss of information. The broad
category requires agreement on the groups of interest, but allows for much more
comprehensible top-line statistics and data quality checks. Rigorous field
testing is required to ensure that the answer categories are comprehensive;
additionally, it is best practice always to include an "other, specify" option.
Keeping track of such responses in the first few weeks of fieldwork is
recommended because adding an answer category for a response frequently showing
up as "other" can save time by avoiding extensive coding later in the project.

It is essential to provide variable names and value labels for the fields in the
questionnaire in a way that will work well in the data analysis software. Most
survey programs do not require such names by default, because naming
restrictions vary across statistical software. Instead, most survey software
implicitly encourages the use of complete sentences as question labels and
detailed descriptions as choice options. This practice is desirable for the
enumerator-respondent interaction, but analysis-compatible labels should now be
programmed in the background so that the resulting data can be imported rapidly
into the analytical software.

There is some debate over how exactly individual questions should be identified:
formats like `dem_1` are hard to remember and unpleasant to reorder, but formats
like `dem_sex_of_respondent` quickly become cumbersome. Using short descriptive
names with clear prefixes is recommended so that variables within a module stay
together when sorted alphabetically—for example, formats like `dem_woman`.
Variable names should never include spaces or mixed cases (DIME prefers using
all lowercase; for more details on naming conventions, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Naming_Conventions>), and they should not be so
long that the software cuts them off, which could result in a loss of uniqueness
and requires a lot of manual work to restore compatibility. Numbering questions
is discouraged, at least at first, because it makes reordering questions
difficult, which is a common change recommended after the pilot. In the case of
follow-up surveys, numbering can quickly become convoluted, too often resulting
in uninformative variables names like `ag_15a`, `ag_15_new`, `ag_15_fup2`, and
so on.

### Using electronic survey features to enhance data quality {-}

Electronic surveys are more than simply a paper questionnaire displayed on a
mobile device or web browser. All common survey software products make it
possible to automate survey logic and include hard or soft constraints on survey
responses. These features make enumerators’ work easier and create an
opportunity to identify and resolve data issues in real time, which simplifies
data cleaning and improves the quality of responses. Well-programmed
questionnaires should include most or all of the following features:

  - *Localization.* The survey instrument should display full-text questions and
    responses in all potential survey languages and should also have English (or
    the primary language of the research team) and code-compatible versions of
    all text and labels.
  - *Survey logic.* Built-in tests should be included for all logic connections
    between questions, so that only relevant questions appear. Enumerators
    should not have to implement complex survey logic themselves. The research
    team should program the instruments to embed simple skip patterns as well as
    more complex interdependencies (for example, a child health module is asked
    only of households that report the presence of a child under five).
  - *Range checks.* Range checks should be added for all numeric variables to
    catch data entry mistakes (for example, `age` must be less than 120).
  - *Confirmation of key variables.* Double entry of essential information (such
    as a contact phone number in a survey with planned phone follow-up) is
    required, with automatic validation that the two entries match and with
    rejection and reentry otherwise.
  - *Multimedia.* Electronic questionnaires facilitate the collection of images,
    video, and geolocation data directly during the survey, using the camera and
    global positioning system (GPS) built into the tablet or phone.
  - *Preloaded data.* Data from previous rounds or related surveys can be used
    to prepopulate certain sections of the questionnaire and be validated during
    the survey.
  - *Filtered-response options.* Filters dynamically reduce the number of
    response options (for example, filtering a "cities" choice list based on the
    state selected).
  - *Location checks.* Enumerators submit their actual location using built-in
    GPS, to confirm that they are in the right place for the interview.
  - *Consistency checks.* It is essential to check that answers to related
    questions align and that a warning is triggered if they do not so that
    enumerators can probe further (for example, if a household reports
    producing 800 kilograms of maize, but selling 900 kilograms of maize from
    its own production).
  - *Calculations.* The electronic survey instrument should do all of the math;
    enumerators should not be asked to do their own calculations.


All established survey software packages include debugging and test options to
correct syntax errors and ensure that the survey instruments will compile
successfully. Such options are not sufficient, however, to ensure that the
resulting data set will load without errors in the data analysis software of
choice. To address this issue, DIME Analytics developed the
`ietestform`^[`ietestform` is a Stata command to test for common errors and
`Stata` best practices in electronic survey forms based on Open Data Kit (ODK),
thereby ensuring that data are easily managed. It is part of the `iefieldkit`
package. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/ietestform.] command
(<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/ietestform>), part of the Stata package
`iefieldkit` (@bjarkefur2020iefieldkit). Intended for use during questionnaire
programming and before fieldwork, `ietestform` tests for best practices in
coding, naming, labeling, and compiling choice lists. Although `ietestform` is
software specific, many of the tests it runs are general and important to
consider regardless of the software chosen. For example, `ietestform` tests that
no variable name exceeds 32 characters, the limit in Stata (variable names
exceeding that limit will be truncated and, as a result, may no longer be
unique). It checks whether ranges are included for numeric variables. It also
removes all leading and trailing blanks from response lists, which could be
handled inconsistently across software.

The final stage of survey piloting, the data-focused pilot, should be done at
this stage (after the questionnaire is programmed). The data-focused pilot is
intended to validate the programming and to export a sample data set.
Significant desk-testing of the instrument is required to debug the programming
as fully as possible before going into the field. It is important to plan for
multiple days of piloting, so that the electronic survey instrument can be
debugged or otherwise revised at the end of each day and tested the following
day, until no further field errors arise. The data-focused pilot should be done
in advance of enumerator training. (For a checklist with best practices
important to remember during a data-focused pilot, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Checklist:_Data-focused_Pilot>.)

### Training enumerators {-}

Once a survey instrument is designed, piloted on paper to refine content,
programmed, piloted electronically to refine the data, and fully translated to
any local languages, it is time to prepare to train the field staff who will be
responsible for conducting interviews. The following guidelines for enumerator
training apply regardless of whether data will ultimately be collected in person
or remotely, with the only significant differences being in terms of survey
protocols and the nature of the field practice (which could be in-person or by
phone).

The first step is to develop a detailed *enumerator manual*. The manual should
explain each question in the survey instrument, address any issues that arose
during piloting, and cover frequently asked questions. The manual should also
describe survey protocols and conventions, such as how to select or confirm the
identity of respondents and standardized means for recording responses such as
"don’t know." The enumerator manual serves as the basis for the
*enumerator training*. Dividing the training into two sessions is recommended:
first, the training-of-trainers and, then, the enumerator training. The
training-of-trainers should include the field supervisors and any other relevant
management staff from the organization responsible for data collection and
should be led by the research team. The objective is to ensure that the survey
leaders are deeply familiar with the survey instrument and protocols, so that
they can support and supervise enumerators going forward. The
training-of-trainers typically lasts a few days, although the exact length will
depend on the complexity of the survey instrument and experience level of the
staff. (For more details on how to design an enumerator manual and a template
for enumerator manuals, among other materials for survey protocol design, see
the DIME Wiki at: <https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Enumerator_Training> and
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Survey_Protocols>.

Enumerator training includes all field staff and should be led jointly by the
research team and the survey managers. This training typically lasts one to two
weeks, although the exact length will depend, again, on the complexity of the
survey and experience level of the enumerators; training for particularly
challenging surveys may take a full month. Enumerator training has three
components: review of the paper questionnaire, review of the electronic survey
instrument, and field practice.
The training schedule should allow for significant discussion and feedback after
each component. Training with a paper survey instrument is critical, even for
surveys that will be deployed electronically. Starting with paper ensures that
enumerators will focus on the content and structure of the survey before diving
into the technical components of the survey software. It is much easier for
enumerators to understand the overall flow of a survey instrument and the range
of possible participant responses using a paper survey than using a tablet, and
it is easier to translate that understanding to digital functionality later. The
classroom training should be very interactive, using methods such as role
playing and mock interviews to test enumerators’ understanding of survey
protocols and modules. The field practice should be supervised carefully to
provide individualized feedback to each enumerator.

When first using the digital form of the survey, enumerators should submit data
from practice interviews to the server, and the research team should run the
standard *data quality checks*^[**Data quality assurance checks** or simply
**data quality checks** are the set of processes put in place to detect
incorrect data points due to survey programming errors, data entry mistakes,
misrepresentation, and other issues. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Monitoring_Data_Quality>.] to familiarize
enumerators with those standards for data quality and how quality issues will be
communicated and resolved. It is essential to train more enumerators than
required for the survey and to include objective assessments throughout the
training. These assessments can take the form of pop quizzes (which should be
done daily, using the same software as the survey), points for participation,
and a score for the field practice. At the end of the training, the aggregate
score should be used to select the final team of enumerators.

### Checking data quality in real time {-}

Once all field staff have been trained, it is time to start collecting data.
Following the guidance in this handbook will set the stage for collecting
quality data. To ensure high-quality data in practice, the research team should
develop a *data quality assurance plan*.^[A **data quality assurance plan** is
the outline of tasks and responsibilities for ensuring that data collected in
the field are accurate. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Quality_Assurance_Plan>.] A key advantage
of electronic data collection methods, as compared to traditional paper surveys
and one-time data dumps, is the ability to access and analyze the data while
they are being collected, allowing issues to be identified and resolved in real
time. The process of designing systematic data checks and running them routinely
throughout data collection simplifies field monitoring and improves data
quality. Two types of checks are important for monitoring data quality:
high-frequency quality checks and field validation.

*High-frequency data quality checks*^[**High-frequency data quality checks**
(HFCs) are data quality checks run in real time during data collection so that
any issues can be addressed while the data collection is still ongoing. For more
details, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/High_Frequency_Checks>.] (HFCs) should be
scripted before data collection begins, so that data checks can start as soon as
data start to arrive. A research assistant should run the HFCs on a daily basis
for the duration of the survey. HFCs should include monitoring the consistency
and range of responses to each question, validating survey programming, testing
for enumerator-specific effects, and checking for duplicate entries and
completeness of online submissions vis-à-vis the field log.

HFCs will improve data quality only if the issues they catch are communicated to
the team collecting the data and if corrections are documented and applied to
the data. This effort requires close communication with the field team, so that
enumerators are promptly made aware of data quality issues and have a
transparent system for documenting issues and corrections. There are many ways
to communicate the results of HFCs to the field team, with the most important
being to create actionable information. `ipacheck`, for example, generates a
spreadsheet with flagged errors; these spreadsheets can be sent directly to the
data collection teams. Many teams display results in other formats, such as
online dashboards created by custom scripts. It is also possible to automate the
communication of errors to the field team by adding scripts to link the HFCs
with a messaging platform. Any of these solutions is possible: what works best
for the team will depend on factors such as cellular networks in fieldwork
areas, whether field supervisors have access to laptops, internet speed, and
coding skills of the team preparing the HFC workflow (see box 4.4. for how data
quality assurance was applied in the Demand for Safe Spaces project).



::: {.ex}
#### BOX 4.4 CHECKING DATA QUALITY IN REAL TIME: A CASE STUDY FROM THE DEMAND FOR SAFE SPACES PROJECT {-}

The Demand for Safe Spaces project created protocols for checking the quality of
the platform survey data. In this case, the survey instrument was programmed for
electronic data collection using the SurveyCTO platform.


  - Enumerators submitted surveys to the server upon completion of interviews.
  - The team’s field coordinator made daily notes of any unusual field occurrences
    in the documentation folder in the project folder shared by the research team.
  - The research team downloaded data daily;
    after each download the research assistant ran coded data quality checks.
    The code was prepared in advance of data collection, based on the pilot data.
  - The data quality checks flagged any duplicated identifications,
    outliers, and inconsistencies in the day’s data.
    Issues were reported to the field team the next day.
    In practice, the only issues flagged were
    higher-than-expected rates of refusal to answer and
    wrongly entered identification numbers.
    The field team responded on the same day to each case,
    and the research assistant documented any resulting changes
    to the data set through code.

The team developed a customized data quality monitoring dashboard to keep all
team members up to date on the survey’s progress and quality. The dashboard
included indicators of progress such as refusal rates, number of surveys
completed, and number of respondents on the previous day or week by gender.
Figure B4.4.1 presents an example of the progress indicators on the dashboard.
The dashboard also illustrated participation in the implicit association test,
by gender and by various demographic characteristics of interest. Visual
descriptive statistics for the main variables of interest were also displayed to
monitor and flag concerns easily.

Careful *field validation* is essential for high-quality survey data. Although
it is impossible to control natural measurement errors (for an example, see
@kondylis2015measuring), which are the result of variation in the
realization of key outcomes, there is often an opportunity to reduce errors
arising from inaccuracies in the data generation process.
*Back-checks*^[**Back-checks** are revisits to already interviewed
respondents, in which the interviewer asks a subset of the survey questions a
second time to audit survey accuracy. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Back_Checks>.], spot
checks, and other validation audits help to ensure that data are not falsified,
incomplete, or otherwise suspect. Field validation also provides an opportunity
to ensure that all field protocols are followed. For back-checks, a random
subset of observations is selected, and a subset of information from the full
survey is verified through a brief targeted survey with the original respondent.
For spot checks, field supervisors (and, if contextually appropriate, research
team staff) should make unannounced field visits to each enumerator, to confirm
first-hand that the enumerator is following survey protocols and understands the
survey questions well. The design of the back-checks or validations follows the
same survey design principles discussed above: the analysis plan or a list of
key outcomes is used to establish which subset of variables to prioritize and to
focus on errors that would be major flags of poor-quality data.

Real-time access to the data massively increases the potential utility of
back-checks and both simplifies and improves the rigor of the associated
workflows. Raw data can be used to draw the back-check or validation sample,
which ensures that the validation is apportioned correctly across observations.
As soon as HFCs are complete, the back-check data can be tested against the
original data to identify areas of concern in real time. The `bcstats` command is
a useful tool for analyzing back-check data in Stata (@white2016bcstats). Some
electronic survey software also provides a unique opportunity to do audits
through audio recordings of the interview, typically short recordings triggered
at random throughout the questionnaire. Such audio audits can be a useful means
to assess whether enumerators are conducting interviews as expected. However,
they must be included in the informed consent for the respondents, and the
recordings will have to be assessed by specially trained staff.



## Handling data securely {-}

All confidential data must be handled so that only people specifically approved
by an IRB or specified in the data license agreement can access the data. Data
can be confidential for multiple reasons; two very common reasons are that the
data contain
*personally identifying information*^[**Personally identifying information**
(PII) is any piece or set of information that can be linked to the identity of
a specific individual. For more details, see the DIME Wiki at <https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Personally_Identifiable_Information_(PII)> and
pillar 4 of the DIME Research Standards at
<https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards>.] (PII) or that the data owner has
specified restricted access.


### Encrypting data {-}

Data *encryption*^[**Encryption** is a process of systematically masking the
underlying information contained in digital files. This process ensures that
file contents are unreadable even if laptops are stolen, databases are hacked,
or any other type of access is obtained which gives unauthorized people access
to the encrypted files. For more about encryption methods, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Encryption>.] is a group of tools and methods
to prevent unauthorized access to confidential files. Encryption is a system
that is only as secure as its weakest link. Therefore, proper encryption can
rarely be condensed into a single tool or method, because the data must be
handled securely as they travel through many servers, devices, and computers
from the source of the data to the final analysis. This section recommends a
streamlined encryption workflow, so that it is as straightforward as possible to
ensure that the entire chain is easy to manage and sufficiently secure. For more
about data security and encryption practices, see the DIME Wiki at
<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Security> or pillar 4 of the DIME Research
Standards at <https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards>.

All encryption relies on a password or encryption key for both encrypting and
decrypting information. Encryption makes data files completely unusable to
anyone who does not have the decryption key. This is a higher level of security
than most password protection, because password-protected information is often
readable if the password is bypassed or the storage hard drive is compromised.
Encryption keys have to be shared and stored carefully; if they are lost or
cannot be matched to encrypted information, the information is permanently lost.
Therefore, access to encryption keys should be treated the same as access to
confidential information. These passwords or keys should never be shared by
email, WhatsApp, or other common modes of communication; instead, using a secure
password manager built for this purpose is recommended. (For DIME’s step-by-step
guide for how to get started with password managers, see pillar 4 of the DIME
Research Standards at <https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards>.)

There are two main types of encryption algorithms: symmetric encryption and
asymmetric encryption. In *symmetric encryption*, the same key is used both to
encrypt and to decrypt the data. In *asymmetric encryption*, one key is used to
encrypt data, and another key from the same “pair” is used to decrypt data. It
is essential to keep track of these keys. While encryption keys for asymmetric
encryption are often provided automatically to the devices recording or
inputting information, only people listed on the IRB should have access to
decryption keys or any key used in symmetric encryption.

There are two important contexts for encryption. *Encryption-in-transit* protects
data sent over the internet. It is a standard, passive protection that almost
all internet-based services use; it rarely needs to be implemented by the
research team unless the project is creating a custom transfer solution.
*Encryption-at-rest* protects data stored on a server, computer, or drive.

Typically, unless the project has access to an approved enterprise version of
data-sharing software, encryption-at-rest will have to be set up for data in two
locations: server or web storage during data acquisition and local storage
afterward. It is never wise to assume that encryption-at-rest is implemented
automatically unless a cybersecurity expert within the organization has
specified that a specific service is appropriate to the particular case. In all
other cases, readers should follow the steps laid out in this section to set up
their own encryption for which they, and only they, are in full control of who
has access to the key.



### Collecting and storing data securely {-}

Most data collection software will automatically encrypt all data in transit
(that is, uploaded from the field or downloaded from the server). However, it is
necessary to ensure that confidential data are protected when stored on a server
owned by the data collection software provider or when people not on the
research team (including local IT support or system administrators trusted by
the research team) can access the location where the information is stored. In
most data collection platforms, users need to enable and operate
encryption-at-rest explicitly. When collecting data, the tablets or the browsers
used for data collection should encrypt all information before submitting it to
the server; information should be decrypted only after it has been downloaded to
the computer where the data will be used.

This case is perfect for using asymmetric encryption in which two keys form a
“public-private key pair.” The public key can safely be sent to all tablets or
browsers so that it can be used for encrypting the data before the information
is submitted to the server. Only the private key in the same key pair can be
used to decrypt those data so the information can be accessed after it has been
received. The private key should be kept secret and not given to anyone not
listed on the IRB. Again, it is essential to store the key pair in a secure
location, such as a secure note in a password manager, because there is no way
to access the data if the private key is lost. If the data collection service
allows users to view data in a web browser, then the encryption is implemented
correctly only if the user is asked for the key each time or is allowed to see
only fields explicitly marked as publishable by the research team.

The data security standards that apply when receiving confidential data from the
field also apply when transferring confidential data to the field, such as
sampling or enumeration lists containing PII. In some survey software, the same
encryption that is used to receive data securely from the field can also be used
to send confidential data, such as an identifying list of respondents, to the
field. Otherwise, it is necessary to create an encrypted folder where the file
is stored, transfer this folder to the field team using any method, and have
them decrypt the information locally using a key that is transferred securely
using a password manager. This process is more similar to the process for
storing data securely, which is discussed next.


Before planning how to send or receive data securely, it is necessary to plan
how to store data securely after the information has been transferred.
Typically, data should be stored so that the information can be decrypted and
accessed, interacted with, and then encrypted again. (Usually, these data will
not be edited, but nonsensitive pieces may be extracted to a less secure
location.) This case is perfect for using symmetric encryption to create an
encrypted folder for which the same key is used both to encrypt and to decrypt
the information. This type of encryption is similar to a physical safe, for
which one key is used to both add and access contents.

An encrypted folder can be set up using, for example, VeraCrypt. Users can
interact with and modify files in an encrypted folder if and only if they have
the key. This is an example of the implementation of encryption-at-rest. There
is absolutely no way to restore the data if the key is lost, so it is impossible
to overstress the importance of using a password manager, or an equally secure
solution, to store these encryption keys.

It is becoming more and more common for development research to use data that
are too big to be stored on a regular computer and need to be stored and
processed in a cloud environment instead. Many cloud storage solutions are
available, and it is necessary to understand how the data are encrypted and how
the keys are handled. In this case, the research team will probably have to ask
a cybersecurity expert. After a secure cloud storage is set up, it is vital to
remember to encrypt the data if samples are downloaded to—for example, to
develop code on—a local computer.


### Backing up original data {-}

In addition to encrypting data, protection is needed to keep the information
from being accidentally overwritten or deleted. This protection is achieved
through a backup protocol, which creates additional copies of the original data,
exactly as received and finalized, in secure locations that remain permanently
available but are not intended for frequent access. The following is an example
of such a protocol:

1.  Create an encrypted folder on a local computer in the shared project folder
    using VeraCrypt.

1.  Download the original data from the data source to the encrypted folder. If
    the data source is a survey and the data were encrypted during data
    collection, *both* keys will be needed: the private key used during data
    collection will be needed to download the data *and* the key used when
    creating the encrypted folder will be needed to save the information there.
    This is the *working copy* of the original data, and it is the copy that
    will be the starting point for data cleaning.

1.  Create a second encrypted folder on an external drive that is kept in a
    location where it is physically secure. The data downloaded in the previous
    step will be copied to this second encrypted folder. This is the
    *master backup copy* of the original data. No one should ever work with these
    data on a day-to-day basis. The encrypted folder for the master backup copy
    must not be the same encrypted folder used for the working copy. It should
    not use the same key, because if the same key is used and lost, access to both
    encrypted folders will be lost. If it is possible to store the external
    drive in a locked physical safe, then it is not necessary to encrypt the
    data, thereby removing the risk associated with losing encryption keys.


1.  Finally, create a third encrypted folder. Either create this folder on a
    computer and upload it to a long-term cloud storage service (not a sync
    software) or create it on another external hard drive or computer that is
    then stored in a second location—for example, in another office. This is the
    *golden master backup copy* of the original data. The golden master copy
    should never be stored in a synced folder, because it will be deleted in the
    cloud storage if it is deleted on the computer. These data exist for
    recovery purposes only; they are not to be worked on or changed.

This handling satisfies the 3-2-1 rule: there are two onsite copies of the data
and one offsite copy, so the data can never be lost in the event of hardware
failure. If all goes well, it will never be necessary to access the master or
golden master copies—but it is important to know that they are there, safe, if
they are ever needed.

## Looking ahead {-}

This chapter provided a road map to the acquisition of original data. It
outlined guidelines for ensuring that the team has effective ownership or
licensing of data that were obtained or collected and for determining how to
make those materials available in the future. It also provided an extensive
guide for one of the most common—and challenging—methods of data collection:
primary electronic surveys. Finally, it emphasized the secure handling of this
potentially sensitive information, providing a range of tools and a complete
workflow for transferring and storing data securely at all times. Once original
data are completely transferred, securely stored, and backed up, the data
acquisition stage is complete, as summarized in figure 4.1. This is when the
heavy lifting with statistical software starts. Before analyzing the data and
answering the project’s research questions, it is necessary to check the quality
of the data acquired, make sure that the right information is in hand and in the
right format, and prepare the information for analysis. This process, called
data cleaning and processing, is described in the next chapter.
